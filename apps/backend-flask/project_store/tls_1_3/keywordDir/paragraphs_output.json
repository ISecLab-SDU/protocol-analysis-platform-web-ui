  "3. Presentation Language": "This document deals with the formatting of data in an external representation. The following very basic and somewhat casually defined presentation syntax will be used.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.2. Miscellaneous": "Comments begin with \"/*\" and end with \"*/\". Optional components are denoted by enclosing them in \"[[ ]]\" (double brackets). Single-byte entities containing uninterpreted data are of type opaque. A type alias T' for an existing type T is defined by: T T';",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.3. Numbers": "The basic numeric data type is an unsigned byte (uint8). All larger numeric data types are constructed from a fixed-length series of bytes concatenated as described in Section 3.1 and are also unsigned. The following numeric types are predefined. The following numeric types are predefined: uint16[2], uint24[3], uint32[4], uint64[8]. All values, here and elsewhere in the specification, are transmitted in network byte (big-endian) order; the uint32 value represented by the hex bytes 01 02 03 04 is equivalent to the decimal value 16909060.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.1. Basic Block Size": "The representation of all data items is explicitly specified. The basic data block size is one byte (i.e., 8 bits). Multiple-byte data items are concatenations of bytes, from left to right, from top to bottom. From the byte stream, a multi-byte item (a numeric in the following example) is formed (using C notation) by: value = (byte[0] << 8*(n-1)) | (byte[1] << 8*(n-2)) | ... | byte[n-1]; This byte ordering for multi-byte values is the commonplace network byte order or big-endian format.",
  "1. Introduction -> 1.3. Updates Affecting TLS 1.2": "This document defines several changes that optionally affect implementations of TLS 1.2, including those which do not also support TLS 1.3. A version downgrade protection mechanism is described in Section 4.1.3. RSASSA-PSS signature schemes are defined in Section 4.2.3. The \"supported_versions\" ClientHello extension can be used to negotiate the version of TLS to use, in preference to the legacy_version field of the ClientHello. The \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension allows a client to indicate which signature algorithms the client can validate in X.509 certificates. Additionally, this document clarifies some compliance requirements for earlier versions of TLS; see Section 9.3.",
  "1. Introduction -> 1.1. Conventions and Terminology": "The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, the key words appear in all capitals, as shown here. The following terms are used: client: The endpoint initiating the TLS connection. connection: A transport-layer connection between two endpoints. endpoint: Either the client or server of the connection. handshake: An initial negotiation between client and server that establishes the parameters of their subsequent interactions within TLS. peer: An endpoint. When discussing a particular endpoint, \"peer\" refers to the endpoint that is not the primary subject of discussion. receiver: An endpoint that is receiving records. sender: An endpoint that is transmitting records. server: The endpoint that did not initiate the TLS connection.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.7. Constants": "Fields and variables may be assigned a fixed value using \"=\", as in: struct { T1 f1 = 8; T2 f2; } T; where T.f1 must always be 8.",
  "2. Protocol Overview -> 2.1. Incorrect DHE Share": "If the client has not provided a sufficient \"key_share\" extension (e.g., the extension includes only DHE or ECDHE groups unacceptable to or unsupported by the server), the server corrects the mismatch with a HelloRetryRequest and the client needs to restart the handshake with an appropriate \"key_share\" extension. If no common cryptographic parameters can be negotiated, the server MUST abort the handshake with an appropriate alert. The message flow for a full handshake with mismatched parameters involves the client sending a ClientHello with key_share, the server responding with a HelloRetryRequest and key_share, followed by the client sending another ClientHello with key_share. The server then sends ServerHello with key_share, EncryptedExtensions, CertificateRequest, Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished. The client responds with Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished, after which application data can be exchanged. The handshake transcript incorporates the initial ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest exchange and is not reset with the new ClientHello. TLS also allows several optimized variants of the basic handshake, as described in the following sections.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.1. Key Exchange Messages": "The key exchange messages are used to determine the security capabilities of the client and the server and to establish shared secrets, including the traffic keys used to protect the rest of the handshake and the data.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.6. Constructed Types": "Structure types may be constructed from primitive types for convenience. Each specification declares a new, unique type. The syntax used for definitions is much like that of C. Structure definitions use syntax like: struct { T1 f1; T2 f2; ... Tn fn; } T; Fixed- and variable-length vector fields are allowed using the standard vector syntax. Structures V1 and V2 in the variants example (Section 3.8) demonstrate the use of structure types. The fields within a structure may be qualified using the type's name, with a syntax much like that available for enumerateds. For example, T.f2 refers to the second field of the previous declaration.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.8. Variants": "Defined structures may have variants based on some knowledge that is available within the environment. The selector must be an enumerated type that defines the possible variants the structure defines. Each arm of the select statement specifies the type of that variant's field and an optional field label. The mechanism by which the variant is selected at runtime is not prescribed by the presentation language. A structure with fields T1 f1, T2 f2, and so on. A field Tn fn, followed by a select statement with cases such as case e1: Te1 with optional label fe1, case e2: Te2 with optional label fe2, and so on. Case en: Ten with optional label fen; }; } Tv; For example: an enumerated type VariantTag with values apple(0) and orange(1); a structure V1 with a uint16 number and a variable-length opaque string of up to 10 bytes; a structure V2 with a uint32 number and a fixed-length opaque string of 10 bytes; a structure VariantRecord with a VariantTag type field and a select statement that chooses V1 for apple or V2 for orange based on VariantRecord.type.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol": "The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters of a connection. Handshake messages are supplied to the TLS record layer, where they are encapsulated within one or more TLSPlaintext or TLSCiphertext structures which are processed and transmitted as specified by the current active connection state. The handshake protocol defines an enumeration of handshake types including client_hello, server_hello, new_session_ticket, end_of_early_data, encrypted_extensions, certificate, certificate_request, certificate_verify, finished, key_update, and message_hash. A handshake structure contains the message type, length, and a selection of message content based on the type. Protocol messages must be sent in the order defined in Section 4.4.1 and shown in the diagrams in Section 2. A peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST abort the handshake with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. New handshake message types are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.4. Vectors": "A vector (single-dimensioned array) is a stream of homogeneous data elements. The size of the vector may be specified at documentation time or left unspecified until runtime. In either case, the length declares the number of bytes, not the number of elements, in the vector. The syntax for specifying a new type, T', that is a fixed-length vector of type T is T T'[n]; Here, T' occupies n bytes in the data stream, where n is a multiple of the size of T. The length of the vector is not included in the encoded stream. In the following example, Datum is defined to be three consecutive bytes that the protocol does not interpret, while Data is three consecutive Datum, consuming a total of nine bytes. Variable-length vectors are defined by specifying a subrange of legal lengths, inclusively, using the notation <floor..ceiling>. When variable-length vectors are encoded, the actual length precedes the vector's contents in the byte stream. The length will be in the form of a number consuming as many bytes as required to hold the vector's specified maximum (ceiling) length. A variable-length vector with an actual length field of zero is referred to as an empty vector. In the following example, \"mandatory\" is a vector that must contain between 300 and 400 bytes of type opaque. The mandatory vector can never be empty. The actual length field consumes two bytes, a uint16, which is sufficient to represent the value 400 (see Section 3.3). Similarly, \"longer\" can represent up to 800 bytes of data, or 400 uint16 elements, and the longer vector may be empty. The encoding of the longer vector will include a two-byte actual length field prepended to the vector. The length of an encoded vector must be an exact multiple of the length of a single element (e.g., a 17-byte vector of uint16 would be illegal). opaque mandatory<300..400>; /* length field is two bytes, cannot be empty */ uint16 longer<0..800>; /* zero to 400 16-bit unsigned integers */",
  "2. Protocol Overview -> 2.3. 0-RTT Data": "When clients and servers share a PSK (either obtained externally or via a previous handshake), TLS 1.3 allows clients to send data on the first flight (\"early data\"). The client uses the PSK to authenticate the server and to encrypt the early data. As shown in Figure 4, the 0-RTT data is just added to the 1-RTT handshake in the first flight. The rest of the handshake uses the same messages as for a 1-RTT handshake with PSK resumption. The client sends a ClientHello with early_data, key_share, psk_key_exchange_modes, and pre_shared_key extensions, along with optional Application Data. The server responds with a ServerHello containing pre_shared_key and key_share extensions, followed by EncryptedExtensions with early_data, and Finished. The client then sends EndOfEarlyData and Finished, after which both parties exchange Application Data. The plus symbol indicates noteworthy extensions sent in the previously noted message. The asterisk indicates optional or situation-dependent messages or extensions that are not always sent. Parentheses indicate messages protected using keys derived from a client_early_traffic_secret. Curly braces indicate messages protected using keys derived from a sender_handshake_traffic_secret. Square brackets indicate messages protected using keys derived from sender_application_traffic_secret_N. The security properties for 0-RTT data are weaker than those for other kinds of TLS data. Specifically, first: 0-RTT data is not forward secret, as it is encrypted solely under keys derived using the offered PSK. Second: There are no guarantees of non-replay between connections. Protection against replay for ordinary TLS 1.3 1-RTT data is provided via the server's Random value, but 0-RTT data does not depend on the ServerHello and therefore has weaker guarantees. This weakness is especially relevant if the data is authenticated either with TLS client authentication or inside the application protocol. The same warnings apply to any use of the early_exporter_master_secret. 0-RTT data cannot be duplicated within a connection (i.e., the server will not process the same data twice for the same connection), and an attacker will not be able to make 0-RTT data appear to be 1-RTT data (because it is protected with different keys). Appendix E.5 contains a description of potential attacks, and Section 8 describes mechanisms which the server can use to limit the impact of replay.",
  "2. Protocol Overview -> 2.2. Resumption and Pre-Shared Key (PSK)": "Although TLS PSKs can be established out of band, PSKs can also be established in a previous connection and then used to establish a new connection (\"session resumption\" or \"resuming\" with a PSK). Once a handshake has completed, the server can send the client a PSK identity that corresponds to a unique key derived from the initial handshake (see Section 4.6.1). The client can then use that PSK identity in future handshakes to negotiate the use of the associated PSK. If the server accepts the PSK, then the security context of the new connection is cryptographically tied to the original connection and the key derived from the initial handshake is used to bootstrap the cryptographic state instead of a full handshake. In TLS 1.2 and below, this functionality was provided by \"session IDs\" and \"session tickets\" [RFC5077 Session Resumption without Server-Side State]. Both mechanisms are obsoleted in TLS 1.3. PSKs can be used with (EC)DHE key exchange in order to provide forward secrecy in combination with shared keys, or can be used alone, at the cost of losing forward secrecy for the application data. Figure 3 shows a pair of handshakes in which the first handshake establishes a PSK and the second handshake uses the PSK. As the server is authenticating via a PSK, it does not send a Certificate or a CertificateVerify message. When a client offers resumption via a PSK, it SHOULD also supply a \"key_share\" extension to the server to allow the server to decline resumption and fall back to a full handshake, if needed. The server responds with a \"pre_shared_key\" extension to negotiate the use of PSK key establishment and can (as shown here) respond with a \"key_share\" extension to do (EC)DHE key establishment, thus providing forward secrecy. When PSKs are provisioned out of band, the PSK identity and the KDF hash algorithm to be used with the PSK MUST also be provisioned. Note: When using an out-of-band provisioned pre-shared secret, a critical consideration is using sufficient entropy during the key generation, as discussed in [RFC4086]. Deriving a shared secret from a password or other low-entropy sources is not secure. A low-entropy secret, or password, is subject to dictionary attacks based on the PSK binder. The specified PSK authentication is not a strong password-based authenticated key exchange even when used with Diffie-Hellman key establishment. Specifically, the PSK authentication does not prevent an attacker that can observe the handshake from performing a brute-force attack on the password/pre-shared key.",
  "3. Presentation Language -> 3.5. Enumerateds": "An additional sparse data type, called \"enum\" or \"enumerated\", is available. Each definition is a different type. Only enumerateds of the same type may be assigned or compared. Every element of an enumerated must be assigned a value, as demonstrated in the following example. Since the elements of the enumerated are not ordered, they can be assigned any unique value, in any order. An enumerated type is defined with elements e1(v1), e2(v2), and so on. The enumerated type Te includes elements up to en(vn) and optional values. Future extensions or additions to the protocol may define new values. Implementations need to be able to parse and ignore unknown values unless the definition of the field states otherwise. An enumerated occupies as much space in the byte stream as would its maximal defined ordinal value. The following definition would cause one byte to be used to carry fields of type Color. The enumerated type Color is defined with elements red(3), blue(5), and white(7). One may optionally specify a value without its associated tag to force the width definition without defining a superfluous element. In the following example, Taste will consume two bytes in the data stream but can only assume the values 1, 2, or 4 in the current version of the protocol. The enumerated type Taste is defined with elements sweet(1), sour(2), bitter(4), and an optional value (32000). The names of the elements of an enumeration are scoped within the defined type. In the first example, a fully qualified reference to the second element of the enumeration would be Color.blue. Such qualification is not required if the target of the assignment is well specified. Color color = Color.blue; /* overspecified, legal */ Color color = blue; /* correct, type implicit */ The names assigned to enumerateds do not need to be unique. The numerical value can describe a range over which the same name applies. The value includes the minimum and maximum inclusive values in that range, separated by two period characters. This range specification is principally useful for reserving regions of the space. The enumerated type Mood is defined with elements sad(0), meh(1..254), and happy(255).",
  "1. Introduction -> 1.2. Major Differences from TLS 1.2": "The following is a list of the major functional differences between TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3. The list is not intended to be exhaustive, and there are many minor differences. The list of supported symmetric encryption algorithms has been pruned of all algorithms that are considered legacy. The algorithms that remain are all Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) algorithms. The cipher suite concept has been changed to separate the authentication and key exchange mechanisms from the record protection algorithm (including secret key length) and a hash to be used with both the key derivation function and handshake message authentication code (MAC). A zero round-trip time (0-RTT) mode was added, saving a round trip at connection setup for some application data, at the cost of certain security properties. Static RSA and Diffie-Hellman cipher suites have been removed; all public-key based key exchange mechanisms now provide forward secrecy. All handshake messages after the ServerHello are now encrypted. The newly introduced EncryptedExtensions message allows various extensions previously sent in the clear in the ServerHello to also enjoy confidentiality protection. The key derivation functions have been redesigned. The new design allows easier analysis by cryptographers due to the improved key separation properties of the key derivation functions. The HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) is used as an underlying primitive. The handshake state machine has been significantly restructured to be more consistent and to remove superfluous messages such as ChangeCipherSpec (except when needed for middlebox compatibility). Elliptic curve algorithms are now in the base spec, and new signature algorithms, such as EdDSA, are included. TLS 1.3 removed point format negotiation in favor of a single point format for each curve. Other cryptographic improvements were made, including changing the RSA padding to use the RSA Probabilistic Signature Scheme (RSASSA-PSS), and the removal of compression, the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and custom Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) groups. The TLS 1.2 version negotiation mechanism has been deprecated in favor of a version list in an extension. The version list in an extension increases compatibility with existing servers that incorrectly implemented version negotiation. Session resumption with and without server-side state as well as the PSK-based cipher suites of earlier TLS versions have been replaced by a single new PSK exchange. References have been updated to point to the updated versions of RFCs, as appropriate (e.g., RFC 5280 rather than RFC 3280).",
  "1. Introduction": "The primary goal of TLS is to provide a secure channel between two communicating peers; the only requirement from the underlying transport is a reliable, in-order data stream. Specifically, the secure channel should provide the following properties: Authentication: The server side of the channel is always authenticated; the client side is optionally authenticated. Authentication can happen via asymmetric cryptography (e.g., RSA, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA), or the Edwards-Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA)) or a symmetric pre-shared key (PSK). Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is only visible to the endpoints. TLS does not hide the length of the data it transmits, though endpoints are able to pad TLS records in order to obscure lengths and improve protection against traffic analysis techniques. Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot be modified by attackers without detection. These properties should be true even in the face of an attacker who has complete control of the network, as described in [RFC3552]. See Appendix E for a more complete statement of the relevant security properties. TLS consists of two primary components: A handshake protocol (Section 4) that authenticates the communicating parties, negotiates cryptographic modes and parameters, and establishes shared keying material. The handshake protocol is designed to resist tampering; an active attacker should not be able to force the peers to negotiate different parameters than they would if the connection were not under attack. A record protocol (Section 5) that uses the parameters established by the handshake protocol to protect traffic between the communicating peers. The record protocol divides traffic up into a series of records, each of which is independently protected using the traffic keys. TLS is application protocol independent; higher-level protocols can layer on top of TLS transparently. The TLS standard, however, does not specify how protocols add security with TLS; how to initiate TLS handshaking and how to interpret the authentication certificates exchanged are left to the judgment of the designers and implementors of protocols that run on top of TLS. This document defines TLS version 1.3. While TLS 1.3 is not directly compatible with previous versions, all versions of TLS incorporate a versioning mechanism which allows clients and servers to interoperably negotiate a common version if one is supported by both peers. This document supersedes and obsoletes previous versions of TLS, including version 1.2. This document also obsoletes the TLS ticket mechanism defined in RFC5077 and replaces the TLS ticket mechanism with the mechanism defined in Section 2.2. Because TLS 1.3 changes the way keys are derived, TLS 1.3 updates RFC5705 as described in Section 7.5. TLS 1.3 also changes how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) messages are carried and therefore updates RFC6066 and obsoletes RFC6961 as described in Section 4.4.2.1.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.6. Post-Handshake Client Authentication": "The \"post_handshake_auth\" extension is used to indicate that a client is willing to perform post-handshake authentication (Section 4.6.2). Servers MUST NOT send a post-handshake CertificateRequest to clients which do not offer this extension. Servers MUST NOT send this extension. The PostHandshakeAuth structure is empty, and the extension_data field of the post_handshake_auth extension has zero length.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.4. Certificate Authorities": "The \"certificate_authorities\" extension is used to indicate the certificate authorities (CAs) which an endpoint supports and which SHOULD be used by the receiving endpoint to guide certificate selection. The body of the \"certificate_authorities\" extension consists of a CertificateAuthoritiesExtension structure. The CertificateAuthoritiesExtension structure contains a list of distinguished names of acceptable certificate authorities, represented in DER-encoded format as specified in X690. These distinguished names specify a desired distinguished name for a trust anchor or subordinate CA; thus, this message can be used to describe known trust anchors as well as a desired authorization space. The client MAY send the \"certificate_authorities\" extension in the ClientHello message. The server MAY send the \"certificate_authorities\" extension in the CertificateRequest message. The \"trusted_ca_keys\" extension, which serves a similar purpose but is more complicated, is not used in TLS 1.3, although it may appear in ClientHello messages from clients offering prior versions of TLS.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.2. Cookie": "Cookies serve two primary purposes: Allowing the server to force the client to demonstrate reachability at their apparent network address (thus providing a measure of DoS protection). This reachability demonstration is primarily useful for non-connection-oriented transports (see [RFC6347] for an example of this functionality). Allowing the server to offload state to the client, thus allowing the server to send a HelloRetryRequest without storing any state. The server can offload state by storing the hash of the ClientHello in the HelloRetryRequest cookie (protected with some suitable integrity protection algorithm). When sending a HelloRetryRequest, the server MAY provide a \"cookie\" extension to the client (this cookie extension is an exception to the usual rule that the only extensions that may be sent are those that appear in the ClientHello). When sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST copy the contents of the extension received in the HelloRetryRequest into a \"cookie\" extension in the new ClientHello. Clients MUST NOT use cookies in their initial ClientHello in subsequent connections. When a server is operating statelessly, it may receive an unprotected record of type change_cipher_spec between the first and second ClientHello (see Section 5). Since the server is not storing any state, this change_cipher_spec record will appear as if it were the first message to be received. Servers operating statelessly MUST ignore these records.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.1. Key Exchange Messages -> 4.1.1. Cryptographic Negotiation": "In TLS, the cryptographic negotiation proceeds by the client offering the following four sets of options in its ClientHello: A list of cipher suites which indicates the AEAD algorithm/HKDF hash pairs which the client supports. A \"supported_groups\" (Section 4.2.7) extension which indicates the (EC)DHE groups which the client supports and a \"key_share\" (Section 4.2.8) extension which contains (EC)DHE shares for some or all of these groups. A \"signature_algorithms\" (Section 4.2.3) extension which indicates the signature algorithms which the client can accept. A \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension (Section 4.2.3) may also be added to indicate certificate-specific signature algorithms. A \"pre_shared_key\" (Section 4.2.11) extension which contains a list of symmetric key identities known to the client and a \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" (Section 4.2.9) extension which indicates the key exchange modes that may be used with PSKs. If the server does not select a PSK, then the first three of these options are entirely orthogonal: the server independently selects a cipher suite, an (EC)DHE group and key share for key establishment, and a signature algorithm/certificate pair to authenticate itself to the client. If there is no overlap between the received \"supported_groups\" and the groups supported by the server, then the server MUST abort the handshake with a \"handshake_failure\" or an \"insufficient_security\" alert. If the server selects a PSK, then it MUST also select a key establishment mode from the set indicated by the client's \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension (at present, PSK alone or with (EC)DHE). Note that if the PSK can be used without (EC)DHE, then non-overlap in the \"supported_groups\" parameters need not be fatal, as it is in the non-PSK case discussed in the previous paragraph. If the server selects an (EC)DHE group and the client did not offer a compatible \"key_share\" extension in the initial ClientHello, the server MUST respond with a HelloRetryRequest (Section 4.1.4) message. If the server successfully selects parameters and does not require a HelloRetryRequest, the server indicates the selected parameters in the ServerHello as follows: If PSK is being used, then the server will send a \"pre_shared_key\" extension indicating the selected key. When (EC)DHE is in use, the server will also provide a \"key_share\" extension. If PSK is not being used, then (EC)DHE and certificate-based authentication are always used. When authenticating via a certificate, the server will send the Certificate (Section 4.4.2) and CertificateVerify (Section 4.4.3) messages. In TLS 1.3 as defined by this document, either a PSK or a certificate is always used, but not both. Future documents may define how to use PSK and certificate together. If the server is unable to negotiate a supported set of parameters (i.e., there is no overlap between the client and server parameters), it MUST abort the handshake with either a \"handshake_failure\" or \"insufficient_security\" fatal alert (see Section 6).",
  "2. Protocol Overview": "The cryptographic parameters used by the secure channel are produced by the TLS handshake protocol. This sub-protocol of TLS is used by the client and server when first communicating with each other. The handshake protocol allows peers to negotiate a protocol version, select cryptographic algorithms, optionally authenticate each other, and establish shared secret keying material. Once the handshake is complete, the peers use the established keys to protect the application-layer traffic. A failure of the handshake or other protocol error triggers the termination of the connection, optionally preceded by an alert message (Section 6). TLS supports three basic key exchange modes: (EC)DHE (Diffie-Hellman over either finite fields or elliptic curves), PSK-only, and PSK with (EC)DHE. Figure 1 below shows the basic full TLS handshake message flow between client and server. The handshake involves ClientHello, ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, CertificateRequest, Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages, with optional extensions and application data exchange. * Indicates optional or situation-dependent messages/extensions that are not always sent. Curly braces indicate messages protected using keys derived from a sender handshake traffic secret. Square brackets indicate messages protected using keys derived from sender application traffic secret N. The handshake can be thought of as having three phases: Key Exchange, which establishes shared keying material and selects the cryptographic parameters. Everything after this phase is encrypted. Server Parameters phase establishes other handshake parameters such as whether the client is authenticated and application-layer protocol support. Authentication phase authenticates the server and optionally the client, providing key confirmation and handshake integrity. In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello (Section 4.1.2) message, which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its offered protocol versions; a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; either a set of Diffie-Hellman key shares (in the \"key_share\" (Section 4.2.8) extension), a set of pre-shared key labels (in the \"pre_shared_key\" (Section 4.2.11) extension), or both; and potentially additional extensions. Additional fields and/or messages may also be present for middlebox compatibility. The server processes the ClientHello and determines the appropriate cryptographic parameters for the connection. It then responds with its own ServerHello (Section 4.1.3), which indicates the negotiated connection parameters. The combination of the ClientHello and the ServerHello determines the shared keys. If (EC)DHE key establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a \"key_share\" extension with the server's ephemeral Diffie-Hellman share; the server's share MUST be in the same group as one of the client's shares. If PSK key establishment is in use, then the ServerHello contains a \"pre_shared_key\" extension indicating which of the client's offered PSKs was selected. Note that implementations can use (EC)DHE and PSK together, in which case both extensions will be supplied. The server then sends two messages to establish the Server Parameters: EncryptedExtensions provides responses to ClientHello extensions that are not required to determine cryptographic parameters, excluding those specific to individual certificates. CertificateRequest specifies desired parameters for certificate-based client authentication if it is desired. This message is omitted if client authentication is not desired. Finally, the client and server exchange Authentication messages. TLS uses the same set of messages every time that certificate-based authentication is needed. PSK-based authentication happens as a side effect of key exchange. Specifically, Certificate message contains the certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate extensions. This message is omitted by the server if not authenticating with a certificate and by the client if the server did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that the client should not authenticate with a certificate). Note that if raw public keys or the cached information extension are in use, then the Certificate message will not contain a certificate but rather some other value corresponding to the server's long-term key. CertificateVerify provides a signature over the entire handshake using the private key corresponding to the public key in the Certificate message. This message is omitted if the endpoint is not authenticating via a certificate. Finished provides a MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the entire handshake. This message provides key confirmation, binds the endpoint's identity to the exchanged keys, and in PSK mode also authenticates the handshake. Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its Authentication messages, namely Certificate and CertificateVerify if requested, and Finished. At this point, the handshake is complete, and the client and server derive the keying material required by the record layer to exchange application-layer data protected through authenticated encryption. Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished message, except as specified in Section 2.3. Note that while the server may send Application Data prior to receiving the client's Authentication messages, any data sent at that point is, of course, being sent to an unauthenticated peer.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.5. OID Filters": "The \"oid_filters\" extension allows servers to provide a set of OID/value pairs which the server would like the client's certificate to match. This extension, if provided by the server, MUST only be sent in the CertificateRequest message. The OIDFilter structure contains certificate_extension_oid and certificate_extension_values fields. The OIDFilterExtension structure contains a filters list. The filters parameter is a list of certificate extension OIDs from RFC5280 Profile with their allowed values, represented in DER-encoded format as specified in X690 Canonical Encoding Rules and Distinguished Encoding Rules. Some certificate extension OIDs allow multiple values (e.g., Extended Key Usage). If the server has included a non-empty filters list, the client certificate included in the response MUST contain all of the specified extension OIDs that the client recognizes. For each extension OID recognized by the client, all of the specified values MUST be present in the client certificate (but the certificate MAY have other values as well). However, the client MUST ignore and skip any unrecognized certificate extension OIDs. If the client ignored some of the required certificate extension OIDs and supplied a certificate that does not satisfy the request, the server MAY at its discretion either continue the connection without client authentication or abort the handshake with an \"unsupported_certificate\" alert. Any given OID MUST NOT appear more than once in the filters list. PKIX RFCs define a variety of certificate extension OIDs and their corresponding value types. Depending on the type, matching certificate extension values are not necessarily bitwise-equal. It is expected that TLS implementations will rely on their PKI libraries to perform certificate selection using certificate extension OIDs. This document defines matching rules for two standard certificate extensions defined in RFC5280 Profile: The Key Usage extension in a certificate matches the request when all key usage bits asserted in the request are also asserted in the Key Usage certificate extension. The Extended Key Usage extension in a certificate matches the request when all key purpose OIDs present in the request are also found in the Extended Key Usage certificate extension. The special anyExtendedKeyUsage OID MUST NOT be used in the request. Separate specifications may define matching rules for other certificate extensions.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.8. Key Share -> 4.2.8.1. Diffie-Hellman Parameters": "Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters for both clients and servers are encoded in the opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a KeyShare structure. The opaque value contains the Diffie-Hellman public value (Y = g^X mod p) for the specified group (see RFC7919 for group definitions) encoded as a big-endian integer and padded to the left with zeros to the size of p in bytes. Note: For a given Diffie-Hellman group, the padding results in all public keys having the same length. Peers MUST validate each other's public key Y by ensuring that 1 < Y < p-1. This check ensures that the remote peer is properly behaved and isn't forcing the local system into a small subgroup.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.1. Key Exchange Messages -> 4.1.4. Hello Retry Request": "The server will send the HelloRetryRequest message in response to a ClientHello message if the server is able to find an acceptable set of parameters but the ClientHello does not contain sufficient information to proceed with the handshake. As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the HelloRetryRequest has the same format as a ServerHello message, and the legacy_version, legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and legacy_compression_method fields have the same meaning. However, for convenience we discuss \"HelloRetryRequest\" throughout this document as if it were a distinct message. The server's extensions MUST contain \"supported_versions\". Additionally, the HelloRetryRequest SHOULD contain the minimal set of extensions necessary for the client to generate a correct ClientHello pair. As with the ServerHello, a HelloRetryRequest MUST NOT contain any extensions that were not first offered by the client in its ClientHello, with the exception of optionally the \"cookie\" (see Section 4.2.2) extension. Upon receipt of a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST check the legacy_version, legacy_session_id_echo, cipher_suite, and legacy_compression_method as specified in Section 4.1.3 and then process the extensions, starting with determining the version using \"supported_versions\". Clients MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert if the HelloRetryRequest would not result in any change in the ClientHello. If a client receives a second HelloRetryRequest in the same connection (i.e., where the ClientHello was itself in response to a HelloRetryRequest), the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. Otherwise, the client MUST process all extensions in the HelloRetryRequest and send a second updated ClientHello. The HelloRetryRequest extensions defined in this specification are: supported_versions (see Section 4.2.1), cookie (see Section 4.2.2), and key_share (see Section 4.2.8). A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake. Servers MUST ensure that they negotiate the same cipher suite when receiving a conformant updated ClientHello (if the server selects the cipher suite as the first step in the negotiation, then the same cipher suite negotiation will happen automatically). Upon receiving the ServerHello, clients MUST check that the cipher suite supplied in the ServerHello is the same as that in the HelloRetryRequest and otherwise abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. In addition, in its updated ClientHello, the client SHOULD NOT offer any pre-shared keys associated with a hash other than that of the selected cipher suite. This restriction allows the client to avoid having to compute partial hash transcripts for multiple hashes in the second ClientHello. The value of selected_version in the HelloRetryRequest \"supported_versions\" extension MUST be retained in the ServerHello, and a client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert if the value changes.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.1. Supported Versions": "The SupportedVersions structure is defined as: for client_hello, it contains a list of ProtocolVersion values; for server_hello, it contains a single ProtocolVersion value. The \"supported_versions\" extension is used by the client to indicate which versions of TLS the client supports and by the server to indicate which version the server is using. The extension contains a list of supported versions in preference order, with the most preferred version first. Implementations of this specification MUST send this extension in the ClientHello containing all versions of TLS which the implementations are prepared to negotiate (for this specification, that means minimally 0x0304, but if previous versions of TLS are allowed to be negotiated, the previous versions MUST be present as well). If this extension is not present, servers which are compliant with this specification and which also support TLS 1.2 MUST negotiate TLS 1.2 or prior as specified in RFC5246, even if ClientHello.legacy_version is 0x0304 or later. Servers MAY abort the handshake upon receiving a ClientHello with legacy_version 0x0304 or later. If this extension is present in the ClientHello, servers MUST NOT use the ClientHello.legacy_version value for version negotiation and MUST use only the \"supported_versions\" extension to determine client preferences. Servers MUST only select a version of TLS present in the \"supported_versions\" extension and MUST ignore any unknown versions that are present in the extension. Note that this mechanism makes it possible to negotiate a version prior to TLS 1.2 if one side supports a sparse range. Implementations of TLS 1.3 which choose to support prior versions of TLS SHOULD support TLS 1.2. Servers MUST be prepared to receive ClientHellos that include this extension but do not include 0x0304 in the list of versions. A server which negotiates a version of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 MUST set ServerHello.version and MUST NOT send the \"supported_versions\" extension. A server which negotiates TLS 1.3 MUST respond by sending a \"supported_versions\" extension containing the selected version value (0x0304). The server MUST set the ServerHello.legacy_version field to 0x0303 (TLS 1.2). Clients MUST check for this extension prior to processing the rest of the ServerHello (although they will have to parse the ServerHello in order to read the extension). If this extension is present, clients MUST ignore the ServerHello.legacy_version value and MUST use only the \"supported_versions\" extension to determine the selected version. If the \"supported_versions\" extension in the ServerHello contains a version not offered by the client or contains a version prior to TLS 1.3, the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.7. Supported Groups": "When sent by the client, the \"supported_groups\" extension indicates the named groups which the client supports for key exchange, ordered from most preferred to least preferred. Note: In versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3, this extension was named \"elliptic_curves\" and only contained elliptic curve groups. See RFC8422 Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security (TLS) Versions 1.2 and Earlier and RFC7919. This extension was also used to negotiate ECDSA curves. Signature algorithms are now negotiated independently (see Section 4.2.3). The \"extension_data\" field of this extension contains a \"NamedGroupList\" value. Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE) indicate support for the corresponding named curve, defined in either FIPS 186-4 DSS or RFC7748. Values 0xFE00 through 0xFEFF are reserved for Private Use [RFC8126]. Finite Field Groups (DHE) indicate support for the corresponding finite field group, defined in RFC7919. Values 0x01FC through 0x01FF are reserved for Private Use. Items in named_group_list are ordered according to the sender's preferences (most preferred choice first). As of TLS 1.3, servers are permitted to send the \"supported_groups\" extension to the client. Clients MUST NOT act upon any information found in \"supported_groups\" prior to successful completion of the handshake but MAY use the information learned from a successfully completed handshake to change what groups they use in their \"key_share\" extension in subsequent connections. If the server has a group it prefers to the ones in the \"key_share\" extension but is still willing to accept the ClientHello, it SHOULD send \"supported_groups\" to update the client's view of its preferences; this extension SHOULD contain all groups the server supports, regardless of whether they are currently supported by the client.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.11. Pre-Shared Key Extension -> 4.2.11.1. Ticket Age": "The client's view of the age of a ticket is the time since the receipt of the NewSessionTicket message. Clients MUST NOT attempt to use tickets which have ages greater than the \"ticket_lifetime\" value which was provided with the ticket. The \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" field of each PskIdentity contains an obfuscated version of the ticket age formed by taking the age in milliseconds and adding the \"ticket_age_add\" value that was included with the ticket (see Section 4.6.1), modulo 2^32. The addition of the \"ticket_age_add\" value prevents passive observers from correlating connections unless tickets are reused. Note that the \"ticket_lifetime\" field in the NewSessionTicket message is in seconds but the \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" is in milliseconds. Because ticket lifetimes are restricted to a week, 32 bits is enough to represent any plausible ticket age, even in milliseconds.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.8. Key Share -> 4.2.8.2. ECDHE Parameters": "ECDHE parameters for both clients and servers are encoded in the opaque key_exchange field of a KeyShareEntry in a KeyShare structure. For secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1, the contents are the serialized value of the following struct: struct { uint8 legacy_form = 4; opaque X[coordinate_length]; opaque Y[coordinate_length]; } UncompressedPointRepresentation; X and Y, respectively, are the binary representations of the x and y values in network byte order. There are no internal length markers, so each number representation occupies as many octets as implied by the curve parameters. For P-256, this means that each of the X and Y coordinates uses 32 octets, padded on the left by zeros if necessary. For P-384, the X and Y coordinates take 48 octets each. For P-521, the X and Y coordinates take 66 octets each. For the curves secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1, peers MUST validate each other's public value Q by ensuring that the point is a valid point on the elliptic curve. The appropriate validation procedures are defined in Section 4.3.7 of [ECDSA] and alternatively in Section 5.6.2.3 of [KEYAGREEMENT]. This process consists of three steps: (1) verify that Q is not the point at infinity (O), (2) verify that for Q = (x, y) both integers x and y are in the correct interval, and (3) ensure that (x, y) is a correct solution to the elliptic curve equation. For these curves, implementors do not need to verify membership in the correct subgroup. For X25519 and X448, the contents of the public value are the byte string inputs and outputs of the corresponding functions defined in [RFC7748]: 32 bytes for X25519 and 56 bytes for X448. Note: Versions of TLS prior to 1.3 permitted point format negotiation; TLS 1.3 removes this feature in favor of a single point format for each curve.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.11. Pre-Shared Key Extension -> 4.2.11.3. Processing Order": "Clients are permitted to \"stream\" 0-RTT data until they receive the server's Finished, only then sending the EndOfEarlyData message, followed by the rest of the handshake. In order to avoid deadlocks, when accepting \"early_data\", servers MUST process the client's ClientHello and then immediately send their flight of messages, rather than waiting for the client's EndOfEarlyData message before sending the server's ServerHello.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.3. Server Parameters": "The next two messages from the server, EncryptedExtensions and CertificateRequest, contain information from the server that determines the rest of the handshake. These messages are encrypted with keys derived from the server_handshake_traffic_secret.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.9. Pre-Shared Key Exchange Modes": "In order to use PSKs, clients MUST also send a \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension. The semantics of this extension are that the client only supports the use of PSKs with these modes, which restricts both the use of PSKs offered in this ClientHello and those which the server might supply via NewSessionTicket. A client MUST provide a \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension if it offers a \"pre_shared_key\" extension. If clients offer \"pre_shared_key\" without a \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension, servers MUST abort the handshake. Servers MUST NOT select a key exchange mode that is not listed by the client. This extension also restricts the modes for use with PSK resumption. Servers SHOULD NOT send NewSessionTicket with tickets that are not compatible with the advertised modes; however, if a server does so, the impact will just be that the client's attempts at resumption fail. The server MUST NOT send a \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension. The PskKeyExchangeMode enum includes psk_ke(0), psk_dhe_ke(1), and values up to 255. The PskKeyExchangeModes struct contains a list of PskKeyExchangeMode values. The psk_ke mode indicates PSK-only key establishment. In psk_ke mode, the server MUST NOT supply a \"key_share\" value. psk_dhe_ke: PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment. In psk_dhe_ke mode, the client and server MUST supply \"key_share\" values as described in Section 4.2.8. Any future values that are allocated must ensure that the transmitted protocol messages unambiguously identify which mode was selected by the server; at present, this is indicated by the presence of the \"key_share\" in the ServerHello.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.1. Key Exchange Messages -> 4.1.3. Server Hello": "The server will send the ServerHello message in response to a ClientHello message to proceed with the handshake if the server is able to negotiate an acceptable set of handshake parameters based on the ClientHello. Structure of the ServerHello message: struct { ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303; Random random; opaque legacy_session_id_echo<0..32>; CipherSuite cipher_suite; uint8 legacy_compression_method = 0; Extension extensions<6..2^16-1>; } ServerHello. The legacy_version field: In previous versions of TLS, the legacy_version field was used for version negotiation and represented the selected version number for the connection. Unfortunately, some middleboxes fail when presented with new values. In TLS 1.3, the TLS server indicates its version using the \"supported_versions\" extension (Section 4.2.1), and the legacy_version field MUST be set to 0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2. The random field consists of 32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator. See Appendix D for details about backward compatibility. See Appendix C for additional information. The last 8 bytes of the random field MUST be overwritten as described below if negotiating TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.1, but the remaining bytes MUST be random. The random structure is generated by the server and MUST be generated independently of the ClientHello.random. legacy_session_id_echo: The contents of the client's legacy_session_id field. Note that the legacy_session_id_echo field is echoed even if the client's value corresponded to a cached pre-TLS 1.3 session which the server has chosen not to resume. A client which receives a legacy_session_id_echo field that does not match what it sent in the ClientHello MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. cipher_suite: The single cipher suite selected by the server from the list in ClientHello.cipher_suites. A client which receives a cipher suite that was not offered MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. legacy_compression_method: A single byte which MUST have the value 0. extensions: A list of extensions. The ServerHello MUST only include extensions which are required to establish the cryptographic context and negotiate the protocol version. All TLS 1.3 ServerHello messages MUST contain the \"supported_versions\" extension. Current ServerHello messages additionally contain either the \"pre_shared_key\" extension or the \"key_share\" extension, or both (when using a PSK with (EC)DHE key establishment). Other extensions (see Section 4.2) are sent separately in the EncryptedExtensions message. For reasons of backward compatibility with middleboxes (see Appendix D.4), the HelloRetryRequest message uses the same structure as the ServerHello, but with the Random field set to the special value of the SHA-256 of \"HelloRetryRequest\". Upon receiving a message with type server_hello, implementations MUST first examine the Random value and, if it matches this special value, process it as described in Section 4.1.4. TLS 1.3 has a downgrade protection mechanism embedded in the server's random value. TLS 1.3 servers which negotiate TLS 1.2 or below in response to a ClientHello MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value specially in their ServerHello. If negotiating TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3 servers MUST set the last 8 bytes of their Random value to the bytes: 44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 01. If negotiating TLS 1.1 or below, TLS 1.3 servers MUST, and TLS 1.2 servers SHOULD, set the last 8 bytes of their ServerHello.Random value to the bytes: 44 4F 57 4E 47 52 44 00. TLS 1.3 clients receiving a ServerHello indicating TLS 1.2 or below MUST check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to either of these values. TLS 1.2 clients SHOULD also check that the last 8 bytes are not equal to the second value if the ServerHello indicates TLS 1.1 or below. If a match is found, the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. The downgrade protection mechanism provides limited protection against downgrade attacks over and above what is provided by the Finished exchange: because the ServerKeyExchange message, which is present in TLS 1.2 and below, includes a signature over both random values, it is not possible for an active attacker to modify the random values without detection as long as ephemeral ciphers are used. The downgrade protection mechanism does not provide downgrade protection when static RSA is used. Note: This is a change from RFC5246, so in practice many TLS 1.2 clients and servers will not behave as specified above. A legacy TLS client performing renegotiation with TLS 1.2 or prior and which receives a TLS 1.3 ServerHello during renegotiation MUST abort the handshake with a \"protocol_version\" alert. Note that renegotiation is not possible when TLS 1.3 has been negotiated.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.11. Pre-Shared Key Extension -> 4.2.11.2. PSK Binder": "The PSK binder value forms a binding between a PSK and the current handshake, as well as a binding between the handshake in which the PSK was generated (if via a NewSessionTicket message) and the current handshake. Each entry in the binders list is computed as an HMAC over a transcript hash (see Section 4.4.1) containing a partial ClientHello up to and including the PreSharedKeyExtension.identities field. That is, the partial ClientHello includes all of the ClientHello but not the binders list itself. The length fields for the message (including the overall length, the length of the extensions block, and the length of the \"pre_shared_key\" extension) are all set as if binders of the correct lengths were present. The PskBinderEntry is computed in the same way as the Finished message (Section 4.4.4) but with the BaseKey being the binder_key derived via the key schedule from the corresponding PSK which is being offered (see Section 7.1). If the handshake includes a HelloRetryRequest, the initial ClientHello and HelloRetryRequest are included in the transcript along with the new ClientHello. For instance, if the client sends ClientHello1, the binder will be computed over: Transcript-Hash(Truncate(ClientHello1)) where Truncate() removes the binders list from the ClientHello. If the server responds with a HelloRetryRequest and the client then sends ClientHello2, the binder will be computed over: Transcript-Hash(ClientHello1, HelloRetryRequest, Truncate(ClientHello2)). The full ClientHello1 and ClientHello2 are included in all other handshake hash computations. Note that in the first flight, Truncate(ClientHello1) is hashed directly, but in the second flight, ClientHello1 is hashed and then reinjected as a \"message_hash\" message, as described in Section 4.4.1.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.3. Server Parameters -> 4.3.1. Encrypted Extensions": "In all handshakes, the server MUST send the EncryptedExtensions message immediately after the ServerHello message. The EncryptedExtensions message is the first message that is encrypted under keys derived from the server_handshake_traffic_secret. The EncryptedExtensions message contains extensions that can be protected, i.e., any which are not needed to establish the cryptographic context but which are not associated with individual certificates. The client MUST check EncryptedExtensions for the presence of any forbidden extensions and if any are found MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. The structure of the EncryptedExtensions message is: struct { Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>; } EncryptedExtensions; where extensions is a list of extensions. For more information, see the table in Section 4.2.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.1. Key Exchange Messages -> 4.1.2. Client Hello": "When a client first connects to a server, it is REQUIRED to send the ClientHello as its first TLS message. The client will also send a ClientHello when the server has responded to its ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest. In that case, the client MUST send the same ClientHello without modification, except as follows: If a \"key_share\" extension was supplied in the HelloRetryRequest, the client must replace the list of shares with a list containing a single KeyShareEntry from the indicated group. The client must remove the \"early_data\" extension (Section 4.2.10) if one was present. Early data is not permitted after a HelloRetryRequest. The client must include a \"cookie\" extension if one was provided in the HelloRetryRequest. The client must update the \"pre_shared_key\" extension if present by recomputing the \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" and binder values and (optionally) removing any PSKs which are incompatible with the server's indicated cipher suite. The client may optionally add, remove, or change the length of the \"padding\" extension [RFC7685 ClientHello Padding Extension]. The client may make other modifications that may be allowed by an extension defined in the future and present in the HelloRetryRequest. Because TLS 1.3 forbids renegotiation, if a server has negotiated TLS 1.3 and receives a ClientHello at any other time, it MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. If a server established a TLS connection with a previous version of TLS and receives a TLS 1.3 ClientHello in a renegotiation, it MUST retain the previous protocol version. In particular, it MUST NOT negotiate TLS 1.3. The structure of the ClientHello message includes: uint16 ProtocolVersion; opaque Random[32]; uint8 CipherSuite[2]; struct { ProtocolVersion legacy_version = 0x0303; Random random; opaque legacy_session_id<0..32>; CipherSuite cipher_suites<2..2^16-2>; opaque legacy_compression_methods<1..2^8-1>; Extension extensions<8..2^16-1>; } ClientHello; legacy_version: In previous versions of TLS, this field was used for version negotiation and represented the highest version number supported by the client. Experience has shown that many servers do not properly implement version negotiation, leading to \"version intolerance\" in which the server rejects an otherwise acceptable ClientHello with a version number higher than it supports. In TLS 1.3, the client indicates its version preferences in the \"supported_versions\" extension (Section 4.2.1) and the legacy_version field MUST be set to 0x0303, which is the version number for TLS 1.2. TLS 1.3 ClientHellos are identified as having a legacy_version of 0x0303 and a supported_versions extension present with 0x0304 as the highest version indicated therein. See Appendix D for details about backward compatibility. The random field consists of 32 bytes generated by a secure random number generator. See Appendix C for additional information. legacy_session_id: Versions of TLS before TLS 1.3 supported a \"session resumption\" feature which has been merged with pre-shared keys in this version (see Section 2.2). A client which has a cached session ID set by a pre-TLS 1.3 server SHOULD set this field to that value. In compatibility mode (see Appendix D.4), this field MUST be non-empty, so a client not offering a pre-TLS 1.3 session MUST generate a new 32-byte value. This value need not be random but SHOULD be unpredictable to avoid implementations fixating on a specific value (also known as ossification). Otherwise, the legacy_session_id field MUST be set as a zero-length vector (i.e., a zero-valued single byte length field). cipher_suites: A list of the symmetric cipher options supported by the client, specifically the record protection algorithm (including secret key length) and a hash to be used with HKDF, in descending order of client preference. Values are defined in Appendix B.4. If the list contains cipher suites that the server does not recognize, support, or wish to use, the server MUST ignore those cipher suites and process the remaining ones as usual. If the client is attempting a PSK key establishment, it SHOULD advertise at least one cipher suite indicating a Hash associated with the PSK. legacy_compression_methods: Versions of TLS before 1.3 supported compression with the list of supported compression methods being sent in this field. For every TLS 1.3 ClientHello, this vector MUST contain exactly one byte, set to zero, which corresponds to the \"null\" compression method in prior versions of TLS. If a TLS 1.3 ClientHello is received with any other value in this field, the server MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. Note that TLS 1.3 servers might receive TLS 1.2 or prior ClientHellos which contain other compression methods and (if negotiating such a prior version) MUST follow the procedures for the appropriate prior version of TLS. extensions: Clients request extended functionality from servers by sending data in the extensions field. The actual \"Extension\" format is defined in Section 4.2. In TLS 1.3, the use of certain extensions is mandatory, as functionality has moved into extensions to preserve ClientHello compatibility with previous versions of TLS. Servers MUST ignore unrecognized extensions. All versions of TLS allow an extensions field to optionally follow the compression_methods field. TLS 1.3 ClientHello messages always contain extensions (minimally \"supported_versions\", otherwise, they will be interpreted as TLS 1.2 ClientHello messages). However, TLS 1.3 servers might receive ClientHello messages without an extensions field from prior versions of TLS. The presence of extensions can be detected by determining whether there are bytes following the compression_methods field at the end of the ClientHello. Note that this method of detecting optional data differs from the normal TLS method of having a variable-length field, but it is used for compatibility with TLS before extensions were defined. TLS 1.3 servers will need to perform this check first and only attempt to negotiate TLS 1.3 if the \"supported_versions\" extension is present. If negotiating a version of TLS prior to 1.3, a server MUST check that the message either contains no data after legacy_compression_methods or that it contains a valid extensions block with no data following. If not, then it MUST abort the handshake with a \"decode_error\" alert. In the event that a client requests additional functionality using extensions and this functionality is not supplied by the server, the client MAY abort the handshake. After sending the ClientHello message, the client waits for a ServerHello or HelloRetryRequest message. If early data is in use, the client may transmit early Application Data (Section 2.3) while waiting for the next handshake message.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.8. Key Share": "The \"key_share\" extension contains the endpoint's cryptographic parameters. Clients MAY send an empty client_shares vector in order to request group selection from the server, at the cost of an additional round trip (see Section 4.1.4). KeyShareEntry structure contains: group - the named group for the key being exchanged; key_exchange - key exchange information. key_exchange: Key exchange information. The contents of this field are determined by the specified group and its corresponding definition. Finite Field Diffie-Hellman [DH76] parameters are described in Section 4.2.8.1; Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman parameters are described in Section 4.2.8.2. In the ClientHello message, the \"extension_data\" field of the key_share extension contains a KeyShareClientHello value with client_shares: a list of offered KeyShareEntry values in descending order of client preference. The client_shares vector MAY be empty if the client is requesting a HelloRetryRequest. Each KeyShareEntry value MUST correspond to a group offered in the \"supported_groups\" extension and MUST appear in the same order. However, the values MAY be a non-contiguous subset of the \"supported_groups\" extension and MAY omit the most preferred groups. Such a situation could arise if the most preferred groups are new and unlikely to be supported in enough places to make pregenerating key shares for them efficient. Clients can offer as many KeyShareEntry values as the number of supported groups the client is offering, each representing a single set of key exchange parameters. For instance, a client might offer shares for several elliptic curves or multiple FFDHE groups. The key_exchange values for each KeyShareEntry MUST be generated independently. Clients MUST NOT offer multiple KeyShareEntry values for the same group. Clients MUST NOT offer any KeyShareEntry values for groups not listed in the client's \"supported_groups\" extension. Servers MAY check for violations of these rules and abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert if one is violated. In a HelloRetryRequest message, the \"extension_data\" field of the key_share extension contains a KeyShareHelloRetryRequest value with selected_group: the mutually supported group the server intends to negotiate and is requesting a retried ClientHello/KeyShare for. Upon receipt of the key_share extension in a HelloRetryRequest, the client MUST verify that (1) the selected_group field corresponds to a group which was provided in the \"supported_groups\" extension in the original ClientHello and (2) the selected_group field does not correspond to a group which was provided in the \"key_share\" extension in the original ClientHello. If either of these checks fails, then the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. Otherwise, when sending the new ClientHello, the client MUST replace the original \"key_share\" extension with one containing only a new KeyShareEntry for the group indicated in the selected_group field of the triggering HelloRetryRequest. In a ServerHello message, the \"extension_data\" field of the key_share extension contains a KeyShareServerHello value with server_share: a single KeyShareEntry value that is in the same group as one of the client's shares. If using (EC)DHE key establishment, servers offer exactly one KeyShareEntry in the ServerHello. The server_share value MUST be in the same group as the KeyShareEntry value offered by the client that the server has selected for the negotiated key exchange. Servers MUST NOT send a KeyShareEntry for any group not indicated in the client's \"supported_groups\" extension and MUST NOT send a KeyShareEntry when using the \"psk_ke\" PskKeyExchangeMode. If using (EC)DHE key establishment and a HelloRetryRequest containing a \"key_share\" extension was received by the client, the client MUST verify that the selected NamedGroup in the ServerHello is the same as the NamedGroup in the HelloRetryRequest. If this check fails, the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions": "A number of TLS messages contain tag-length-value encoded extensions structures. The Extension structure contains ExtensionType extension_type and opaque extension_data<0..2^16-1>. ExtensionType enum includes server_name(0), max_fragment_length(1), status_request(5), supported_groups(10), signature_algorithms(13), use_srtp(14), heartbeat(15), application_layer_protocol_negotiation(16), signed_certificate_timestamp(18), client_certificate_type(19), server_certificate_type(20), padding(21), pre_shared_key(41), early_data(42), supported_versions(43), cookie(44), psk_key_exchange_modes(45), certificate_authorities(47), oid_filters(48), post_handshake_auth(49), signature_algorithms_cert(50), key_share(51), and (65535). Here: extension_type identifies the particular extension type. extension_data contains information specific to the particular extension type. The list of extension types is maintained by IANA as described in Section 11. Extensions are generally structured in a request/response fashion, though some extensions are just indications with no corresponding response. The client sends its extension requests in the ClientHello message, and the server sends its extension responses in the ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, HelloRetryRequest, and Certificate messages. The server sends extension requests in the CertificateRequest message which a client MAY respond to with a Certificate message. The server MAY also send unsolicited extensions in the NewSessionTicket, though the client does not respond directly to these. Implementations MUST NOT send extension responses if the remote endpoint did not send the corresponding extension requests, with the exception of the \"cookie\" extension in the HelloRetryRequest. Upon receiving an extension response without a corresponding request, an endpoint MUST abort the handshake with an \"unsupported_extension\" alert. The table below indicates the messages where a given extension may appear, using the following notation: CH (ClientHello), SH (ServerHello), EE (EncryptedExtensions), CT (Certificate), CR (CertificateRequest), NST (NewSessionTicket), and HRR (HelloRetryRequest). If an implementation receives an extension which it recognizes and which is not specified for the message in which it appears, it MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. The table indicates messages where extensions may appear: server_name in CH and EE, max_fragment_length in CH and EE, status_request in CH, CR, and CT, supported_groups in CH and EE, signature_algorithms in CH and CR, use_srtp in CH and EE, heartbeat in CH and EE, application_layer_protocol_negotiation in CH and EE, signed_certificate_timestamp in CH, CR, and CT, client_certificate_type in CH and EE, server_certificate_type in CH and EE, padding in CH, key_share in CH, SH, and HRR, pre_shared_key in CH and SH, psk_key_exchange_modes in CH, early_data in CH, EE, and NST, cookie in CH and HRR, supported_versions in CH, SH, and HRR, certificate_authorities in CH and CR, oid_filters in CR, post_handshake_auth in CH, and signature_algorithms_cert in CH and CR. When multiple extensions of different types are present, the extensions MAY appear in any order, with the exception of pre_shared_key which MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello but can appear anywhere in the ServerHello extensions block. There MUST NOT be more than one extension of the same type in a given extension block. In TLS 1.3, unlike TLS 1.2, extensions are negotiated for each handshake even when in resumption-PSK mode. However, 0-RTT parameters are those negotiated in the previous handshake; mismatches may require rejecting 0-RTT (see Section 4.2.10). There are subtle (and not so subtle) interactions that may occur in this protocol between new features and existing features which may result in a significant reduction in overall security. The following considerations should be taken into account when designing new extensions: Some cases where a server does not agree to an extension are error conditions such as the handshake cannot continue, and some are simply refusals to support particular features. In general, error alerts should be used for error conditions and a field in the server extension response for refusals to support features. Extensions should, as far as possible, be designed to prevent any attack that forces use or non-use of a particular feature by manipulation of handshake messages. This principle should be followed regardless of whether the feature is believed to cause a security problem. Often the fact that the extension fields are included in the inputs to the Finished message hashes will be sufficient, but extreme care is needed when the extension changes the meaning of messages sent in the handshake phase. Designers and implementors should be aware of the fact that until the handshake has been authenticated, active attackers can modify messages and insert, remove, or replace extensions.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.3. Server Parameters -> 4.3.2. Certificate Request": "A server which is authenticating with a certificate MAY optionally request a certificate from the client. The CertificateRequest message, if sent, MUST follow EncryptedExtensions. The structure of the CertificateRequest message is: struct { opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>; Extension extensions<2..2^16-1>; } CertificateRequest; certificate_request_context: An opaque string which identifies the certificate request and which will be echoed in the client's Certificate message. The certificate_request_context MUST be unique within the scope of this connection (thus preventing replay of client CertificateVerify messages). The certificate_request_context field SHALL be zero length unless used for the post-handshake authentication exchanges described in Section 4.6.2. When requesting post-handshake authentication, the server SHOULD make the certificate_request_context unpredictable to the client (e.g., by randomly generating it) in order to prevent an attacker who has temporary access to the client's private key from pre-computing valid CertificateVerify messages. extensions: A set of extensions describing the parameters of the certificate being requested. The \"signature_algorithms\" extension MUST be specified, and other extensions may optionally be included if defined for this message. Clients MUST ignore unrecognized extensions. In prior versions of TLS, the CertificateRequest message carried a list of signature algorithms and certificate authorities which the server would accept. In TLS 1.3, the list of signature algorithms is expressed by sending the \"signature_algorithms\" and optionally \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extensions. The list of certificate authorities is expressed by sending the \"certificate_authorities\" extension (see Section 4.2.4). Servers which are authenticating with a PSK MUST NOT send the CertificateRequest message in the main handshake, though they MAY send it in post-handshake authentication (see Section 4.6.2) provided that the client has sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension (see Section 4.2.6).",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.1. The Transcript Hash": "Many of the cryptographic computations in TLS make use of a transcript hash. This value is computed by hashing the concatenation of each included handshake message, including the handshake message header carrying the handshake message type and length fields, but not including record layer headers. That is, Transcript-Hash(M1, M2, ... Mn) = Hash(M1 || M2 || ... || Mn). As an exception to this general rule, when the server responds to a ClientHello with a HelloRetryRequest, the value of ClientHello1 is replaced with a special synthetic handshake message of handshake type \"message_hash\" containing Hash(ClientHello1). That is, Transcript-Hash(ClientHello1, HelloRetryRequest, ... Mn) = Hash(message_hash || handshake type 00 00 Hash.length || handshake message length in bytes Hash(ClientHello1) || hash of ClientHello1 HelloRetryRequest || ... || Mn). The reason for this construction is to allow the server to do a stateless HelloRetryRequest by storing just the hash of ClientHello1 in the cookie, rather than requiring the server to export the entire intermediate hash state (see Section 4.2.2). For concreteness, the transcript hash is always taken from the following sequence of handshake messages, starting at the first ClientHello and including only those messages that were sent: ClientHello, HelloRetryRequest, ClientHello, ServerHello, EncryptedExtensions, server CertificateRequest, server Certificate, server CertificateVerify, server Finished, EndOfEarlyData, client Certificate, client CertificateVerify, client Finished. In general, implementations can implement the transcript by keeping a running transcript hash value based on the negotiated hash. Note, however, that subsequent post-handshake authentications do not include each other, just the messages through the end of the main handshake.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.2. Certificate -> 4.4.2.3. Client Certificate Selection": "The following rules apply to certificates sent by the client: The certificate type MUST be X.509v3 [RFC5280 Profile], unless explicitly negotiated otherwise (e.g., [RFC7250 and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)]). If the \"certificate_authorities\" extension in the CertificateRequest message was present, at least one of the certificates in the certificate chain SHOULD be issued by one of the listed CAs. The certificates MUST be signed using an acceptable signature algorithm, as described in Section 4.3.2. Note that the requirement for certificates to be signed using an acceptable signature algorithm relaxes the constraints on certificate-signing algorithms found in prior versions of TLS. If the CertificateRequest message contained a non-empty \"oid_filters\" extension, the end-entity certificate MUST match the extension OIDs that are recognized by the client, as described in Section 4.2.5.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.2. Certificate -> 4.4.2.1. OCSP Status and SCT Extensions": "[RFC6066] and [RFC6961] provide extensions to negotiate the server sending OCSP responses to the client. In TLS 1.2 and below, the server replies with an empty extension to indicate negotiation of this extension and the OCSP information is carried in a CertificateStatus message. In TLS 1.3, the server's OCSP information is carried in an extension in the CertificateEntry containing the associated certificate. Specifically, the body of the \"status_request\" extension from the server MUST be a CertificateStatus structure as defined in [RFC6066], which is interpreted as defined in [RFC6960]. Note: The status_request_v2 extension [RFC6961] is deprecated. TLS 1.3 servers MUST NOT act upon the presence of the status_request_v2 extension or information in the status_request_v2 extension when processing ClientHello messages; in particular, TLS 1.3 servers MUST NOT send the status_request_v2 extension in the EncryptedExtensions, CertificateRequest, or Certificate messages. TLS 1.3 servers MUST be able to process ClientHello messages that include the status_request_v2 extension, as the status_request_v2 extension MAY be sent by clients that wish to use the status_request_v2 extension in earlier protocol versions. A server MAY request that a client present an OCSP response with its certificate by sending an empty \"status_request\" extension in its CertificateRequest message. If the client opts to send an OCSP response, the body of the client's \"status_request\" extension MUST be a CertificateStatus structure as defined in [RFC6066]. Similarly, [RFC6962] provides a mechanism for a server to send a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) as an extension in the ServerHello in TLS 1.2 and below. In TLS 1.3, the server's SCT information is carried in an extension in the CertificateEntry.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages": "As discussed in Section 2, TLS generally uses a common set of messages for authentication, key confirmation, and handshake integrity: Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished. The PSK binders also perform key confirmation in a similar fashion. The Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages are always sent as the last messages in their handshake flight. The Certificate and CertificateVerify messages are only sent under certain circumstances, as defined below. The Finished message is always sent as part of the Authentication Block. The Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages are encrypted under keys derived from the sender_handshake_traffic_secret. The computations for the Authentication messages all uniformly take the following inputs: The certificate and signing key to be used. A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be included in the transcript hash. A Base Key to be used to compute a MAC key. Based on these inputs, the messages then contain: Certificate: The certificate to be used for authentication, and any supporting certificates in the chain. Note that certificate-based client authentication is not available in PSK handshake flows (including 0-RTT). CertificateVerify: A signature over the value Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate). Finished: A MAC over the value Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate, CertificateVerify) using a MAC key derived from the Base Key. The following table defines the Handshake Context and MAC Base Key for each scenario: Server mode uses ClientHello through later messages of EncryptedExtensions or CertificateRequest with server_handshake_traffic_secret as Base Key. Client mode uses ClientHello through later messages of server Finished or EndOfEarlyData with client_handshake_traffic_secret as Base Key. Post-Handshake mode uses ClientHello through client Finished plus CertificateRequest with client_application_traffic_secret_N as Base Key. client | client_application_traffic_ | | Handshake | Finished + | secret_N | | | CertificateRequest | | +-----------+-------------------------+-----------------------------+",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.6. Post-Handshake Messages": "TLS also allows other messages to be sent after the main handshake. These messages use a handshake content type and are encrypted under the appropriate application traffic key.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.11. Pre-Shared Key Extension": "The \"pre_shared_key\" extension is used to negotiate the identity of the pre-shared key to be used with a given handshake in association with PSK key establishment. The \"extension_data\" field of the \"pre_shared_key\" extension contains a \"PreSharedKeyExtension\" value. The structure includes: PskIdentity with identity (a label for a key) and obfuscated_ticket_age; PskBinderEntry; OfferedPsks with identities and binders; and PreSharedKeyExtension which varies by handshake message type. For instance, a ticket (as defined in Appendix B.3.4) or a label for a pre-shared key established externally. obfuscated_ticket_age: An obfuscated version of the age of the key. Section 4.2.11.1 describes how to form the obfuscated_ticket_age value for identities established via the NewSessionTicket message. For identities established externally, an obfuscated_ticket_age of 0 SHOULD be used, and servers MUST ignore the value. identities: A list of the identities that the client is willing to negotiate with the server. If sent alongside the \"early_data\" extension (see Section 4.2.10), the first identity is the one used for 0-RTT data. binders: A series of HMAC values, one for each value in the identities list and in the same order, computed as described below. selected_identity: The server's chosen identity expressed as a (0-based) index into the identities in the client's list. Each PSK is associated with a single Hash algorithm. For PSKs established via the ticket mechanism (Section 4.6.1), the Hash algorithm is the KDF Hash algorithm on the connection where the ticket was established. For externally established PSKs, the Hash algorithm MUST be set when the PSK is established or default to SHA-256 if no such algorithm is defined. The server MUST ensure that it selects a compatible PSK (if any) and cipher suite. In TLS versions prior to TLS 1.3, the Server Name Identification (SNI) value was intended to be associated with the session (Section 3 of RFC6066), with the server being required to enforce that the SNI value associated with the session matches the one specified in the resumption handshake. However, in reality the implementations were not consistent on which of two supplied SNI values they would use, leading to the consistency requirement being de facto enforced by the clients. In TLS 1.3, the SNI value is always explicitly specified in the resumption handshake, and there is no need for the server to associate an SNI value with the ticket. Clients, however, SHOULD store the SNI with the PSK to fulfill the requirements of Section 4.6.1. Implementor's note: When session resumption is the primary use case of PSKs, the most straightforward way to implement the PSK/cipher suite matching requirements is to negotiate the cipher suite first and then exclude any incompatible PSKs. Any unknown PSKs (e.g., ones not in the PSK database or encrypted with an unknown key) SHOULD simply be ignored. If no acceptable PSKs are found, the server SHOULD perform a non-PSK handshake if possible. If backward compatibility is important, client-provided, externally established PSKs SHOULD influence cipher suite selection. Prior to accepting PSK key establishment, the server MUST validate the corresponding binder value (see Section 4.2.11.2 below). If the binder value is not present or does not validate, the server MUST abort the handshake. Servers SHOULD NOT attempt to validate multiple binders; rather, they SHOULD select a single PSK and validate solely the binder that corresponds to that PSK. See Section 8.2 and Appendix E.6 for the security rationale for this requirement. In order to accept PSK key establishment, the server sends a \"pre_shared_key\" extension indicating the selected identity. Clients MUST verify that the server's selected_identity is within the range supplied by the client, that the server selected a cipher suite indicating a Hash associated with the PSK, and that a server \"key_share\" extension is present if required by the ClientHello \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" extension. If these values are not consistent, the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. If the server supplies an \"early_data\" extension, the client MUST verify that the server's selected_identity is 0. If any other value is returned, the client MUST abort the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. The \"pre_shared_key\" extension MUST be the last extension in the ClientHello (this facilitates implementation as described below). Servers MUST check that the \"pre_shared_key\" extension is the last extension and otherwise fail the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.2. Certificate -> 4.4.2.4. Receiving a Certificate Message": "In general, detailed certificate validation procedures are out of scope for TLS (see RFC5280 Profile). This section provides TLS-specific requirements. If the server supplies an empty Certificate message, the client MUST abort the handshake with a \"decode_error\" alert. If the client does not send any certificates (i.e., it sends an empty Certificate message), the server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake without client authentication or abort the handshake with a \"certificate_required\" alert. Also, if some aspect of the certificate chain was unacceptable (e.g., it was not signed by a known, trusted CA), the server MAY at its discretion either continue the handshake (considering the client unauthenticated) or abort the handshake. Any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using an MD5 hash MUST abort the handshake with a \"bad_certificate\" alert. SHA-1 is deprecated, and it is RECOMMENDED that any endpoint receiving any certificate which it would need to validate using any signature algorithm using a SHA-1 hash abort the handshake with a \"bad_certificate\" alert. For clarity, this means that endpoints can accept these algorithms for certificates that are self-signed or are trust anchors. All endpoints are RECOMMENDED to transition to SHA-256 or better as soon as possible to maintain interoperability with implementations currently in the process of phasing out SHA-1 support. Note that a certificate containing a key for one signature algorithm MAY be signed using a different signature algorithm (for instance, an RSA key signed with an ECDSA key).",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.5. End of Early Data": "If the server sent an \"early_data\" extension in EncryptedExtensions, the client MUST send an EndOfEarlyData message after receiving the server Finished. If the server does not send an \"early_data\" extension in EncryptedExtensions, then the client MUST NOT send an EndOfEarlyData message. The EndOfEarlyData message indicates that all 0-RTT application_data messages, if any, have been transmitted and that the following records are protected under handshake traffic keys. Servers MUST NOT send the EndOfEarlyData message, and clients receiving the EndOfEarlyData message MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. The EndOfEarlyData message is encrypted under keys derived from the client_early_traffic_secret.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.2. Certificate -> 4.4.2.2. Server Certificate Selection": "The following rules apply to the certificates sent by the server: The certificate type MUST be X.509v3 as specified in RFC5280 Profile, unless explicitly negotiated otherwise, such as with RFC7250 and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS). The server's end-entity certificate's public key and associated restrictions MUST be compatible with the selected authentication algorithm from the client's signature_algorithms extension, which currently includes RSA, ECDSA, or EdDSA. The certificate MUST allow the key to be used for signing, meaning the digitalSignature bit MUST be set if the Key Usage extension is present, with a signature scheme indicated in the client's signature_algorithms or signature_algorithms_cert extensions as described in Section 4.2.3. The server_name extension as defined in RFC6066 and the certificate_authorities extension are used to guide certificate selection. As servers MAY require the presence of the \"server_name\" extension, clients SHOULD send this extension, when applicable. All certificates provided by the server MUST be signed by a signature algorithm advertised by the client if the server is able to provide such a chain, as described in Section 4.2.3. Certificates that are self-signed or certificates that are expected to be trust anchors are not validated as part of the chain and therefore MAY be signed with any algorithm. If the server cannot produce a certificate chain that is signed only via the indicated supported algorithms, then the server SHOULD continue the handshake by sending the client a certificate chain of its choice that may include algorithms not known to be supported by the client. This fallback chain SHOULD NOT use the deprecated SHA-1 hash algorithm in general, but MAY use SHA-1 if the client's advertisement permits it, and MUST NOT use SHA-1 otherwise. If the client cannot construct an acceptable chain using the provided certificates and decides to abort the handshake, then the client MUST abort the handshake with an appropriate certificate-related alert, such as unsupported_certificate by default, as detailed in Section 6.2. If the server has multiple certificates, the server chooses one of them based on the above-mentioned criteria, in addition to other criteria such as transport-layer endpoint, local configuration, and preferences.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.10. Early Data Indication": "When a PSK is used and early data is allowed for that PSK, the client can send Application Data in its first flight of messages. If the client opts to do so, it MUST supply both the \"pre_shared_key\" and \"early_data\" extensions. The \"extension_data\" field of this extension contains an \"EarlyDataIndication\" value. The EarlyDataIndication structure is defined with different cases for handshake message types: for new_session_ticket it contains a max_early_data_size field, while for client_hello and encrypted_extensions it contains an empty structure. See Section 4.6.1 for details regarding the use of the max_early_data_size field. The parameters for the 0-RTT data (version, symmetric cipher suite, Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN) protocol, etc.) are those associated with the PSK in use. For externally provisioned PSKs, the associated values are those provisioned along with the key. For PSKs established via a NewSessionTicket message, the associated values are those which were negotiated in the connection which established the PSK. The PSK used to encrypt the early data MUST be the first PSK listed in the client's \"pre_shared_key\" extension. For PSKs provisioned via NewSessionTicket, a server MUST validate that the ticket age for the selected PSK identity (computed by subtracting ticket_age_add from PskIdentity.obfuscated_ticket_age modulo 2^32) is within a small tolerance of the time since the ticket was issued (see Section 8). If the ticket age is not within tolerance, the server SHOULD proceed with the handshake but reject 0-RTT, and SHOULD NOT take any other action that assumes that this ClientHello is fresh. 0-RTT messages sent in the first flight have the same (encrypted) content types as messages of the same type sent in other flights (handshake and application_data) but are protected under different keys. After receiving the server's Finished message, if the server has accepted early data, an EndOfEarlyData message will be sent to indicate the key change. This message will be encrypted with the 0-RTT traffic keys. A server which receives an \"early_data\" extension MUST behave in one of three ways: Ignore the extension and return a regular 1-RTT response. The server then skips past early data by attempting to deprotect received records using the handshake traffic key, discarding records which fail deprotection (up to the configured max_early_data_size). Once a record is deprotected successfully, it is treated as the start of the client's second flight and the server proceeds as with an ordinary 1-RTT handshake. Request that the client send another ClientHello by responding with a HelloRetryRequest. A client MUST NOT include the \"early_data\" extension in its followup ClientHello. The server then ignores early data by skipping all records with an external content type of \"application_data\" (indicating that they are encrypted), up to the configured max_early_data_size. Return its own \"early_data\" extension in EncryptedExtensions, indicating that it intends to process the early data. It is not possible for the server to accept only a subset of the early data messages. Even though the server sends a message accepting early data, the actual early data itself may already be in flight by the time the server generates this message. In order to accept early data, the server MUST have accepted a PSK cipher suite and selected the first key offered in the client's \"pre_shared_key\" extension. In addition, the server MUST verify that the following values are the same as those associated with the selected PSK: The TLS version number, the selected cipher suite, and the selected ALPN protocol if any. These requirements are a superset of those needed to perform a 1-RTT handshake using the PSK in question. For externally established PSKs, the associated values are those provisioned along with the key. For PSKs established via a NewSessionTicket message, the associated values are those negotiated in the connection during which the ticket was established. Future extensions MUST define their interaction with 0-RTT. If any of these checks fail, the server MUST NOT respond with the extension and must discard all the first-flight data using one of the first two mechanisms listed above (thus falling back to 1-RTT or 2-RTT). If the client attempts a 0-RTT handshake but the server rejects it, the server will generally not have the 0-RTT record protection keys and must instead use trial decryption (either with the 1-RTT handshake keys or by looking for a cleartext ClientHello in the case of a HelloRetryRequest) to find the first non-0-RTT message. If the server chooses to accept the \"early_data\" extension, then it MUST comply with the same error-handling requirements specified for all records when processing early data records. Specifically, if the server fails to decrypt a 0-RTT record following an accepted \"early_data\" extension, it MUST terminate the connection with a \"bad_record_mac\" alert as per Section 5.2. If the server rejects the \"early_data\" extension, the client application MAY opt to retransmit the Application Data previously sent in early data once the handshake has been completed. Note that automatic retransmission of early data could result in incorrect assumptions regarding the status of the connection. For instance, when the negotiated connection selects a different ALPN protocol from what was used for the early data, an application might need to construct different messages. Similarly, if early data assumes anything about the connection state, it might be sent in error after the handshake completes. A TLS implementation SHOULD NOT automatically resend early data; applications are in a better position to decide when retransmission is appropriate. A TLS implementation MUST NOT automatically resend early data unless the negotiated connection selects the same ALPN protocol.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.6. Post-Handshake Messages -> 4.6.2. Post-Handshake Authentication": "When the client has sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension (see Section 4.2.6), a server MAY request client authentication at any time after the handshake has completed by sending a CertificateRequest message. The client MUST respond with the appropriate Authentication messages (see Section 4.4). If the client chooses to authenticate, the client MUST send Certificate, CertificateVerify, and Finished messages. If the client declines, the client MUST send a Certificate message containing no certificates followed by a Finished message. All of the client's messages for a given response MUST appear consecutively on the wire with no intervening messages of other types. A client that receives a CertificateRequest message without having sent the \"post_handshake_auth\" extension MUST send an \"unexpected_message\" fatal alert. Note: Because client authentication could involve prompting the user, servers MUST be prepared for some delay, including receiving an arbitrary number of other messages between sending the CertificateRequest and receiving a response. In addition, clients which receive multiple CertificateRequests in close succession MAY respond to them in a different order than they were received (the certificate_request_context value allows the server to disambiguate the responses).",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.2. Certificate": "This message conveys the endpoint's certificate chain to the peer. The server MUST send a Certificate message whenever the agreed-upon key exchange method uses certificates for authentication (this includes all key exchange methods defined in this document except PSK). The client MUST send a Certificate message if and only if the server has requested client authentication via a CertificateRequest message (Section 4.3.2). If the server requests client authentication but no suitable certificate is available, the client MUST send a Certificate message containing no certificates (i.e., with the \"certificate_list\" field having length 0). A Finished message MUST be sent regardless of whether the Certificate message is empty. The structure of the Certificate message includes: an enumeration of certificate types (X509(0), RawPublicKey(2), and others up to 255); a CertificateEntry structure that contains either an ASN.1 subjectPublicKeyInfo for RawPublicKey or certificate data for X509, along with extensions; and a Certificate structure with certificate_request_context and certificate_list fields. The certificate_request_context field contains the value from the CertificateRequest message if this message is a response to one. Otherwise, in the case of server authentication, the certificate_request_context field SHALL be zero length. The certificate_list is a sequence (chain) of CertificateEntry structures, each containing a single certificate and set of extensions. The extensions are a set of extension values for the CertificateEntry. The \"Extension\" format is defined in Section 4.2. Valid extensions for server certificates at present include the OCSP Status extension from RFC6066 and the SignedCertificateTimestamp extension from RFC6962; future extensions may be defined for this message as well. Extensions in the Certificate message from the server MUST correspond to ones from the ClientHello message. Extensions in the Certificate message from the client MUST correspond to extensions in the CertificateRequest message from the server. If an extension applies to the entire chain, it SHOULD be included in the first CertificateEntry. If the corresponding certificate type extension (\"server_certificate_type\" or \"client_certificate_type\") was not negotiated in EncryptedExtensions, or the X.509 certificate type was negotiated, then each CertificateEntry contains a DER-encoded X.509 certificate. The sender's certificate MUST come in the first CertificateEntry in the list. Each following certificate SHOULD directly certify the one immediately preceding it. Because certificate validation requires that trust anchors be distributed independently, a certificate that specifies a trust anchor MAY be omitted from the chain, provided that supported peers are known to possess any omitted certificates. Note: Prior to TLS 1.3, \"certificate_list\" ordering required each certificate to certify the one immediately preceding it; however, some implementations allowed some flexibility. Servers sometimes send both a current and deprecated intermediate for transitional purposes, and others are simply configured incorrectly, but these cases can nonetheless be validated properly. For maximum compatibility, all implementations SHOULD be prepared to handle potentially extraneous certificates and arbitrary orderings from any TLS version, with the exception of the end-entity certificate which MUST be first. If the RawPublicKey certificate type was negotiated, then the certificate_list MUST contain no more than one CertificateEntry, which contains an ASN.1 subjectPublicKeyInfo value as defined in RFC7250, Section 3. The OpenPGP certificate type from RFC6091 MUST NOT be used with TLS 1.3. The server's certificate_list MUST always be non-empty. A client will send an empty certificate_list if it does not have an appropriate certificate to send in response to the server's authentication request.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.2. Extensions -> 4.2.3. Signature Algorithms": "TLS 1.3 provides two extensions for indicating which signature algorithms may be used in digital signatures. The \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension applies to signatures in certificates, and the \"signature_algorithms\" extension, which originally appeared in TLS 1.2, applies to signatures in CertificateVerify messages. The keys found in certificates MUST also be of appropriate type for the signature algorithms the keys are used with. The requirement for keys to be of appropriate type for signature algorithms is a particular issue for RSA keys and PSS signatures, as described below. If no \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension is present, then the \"signature_algorithms\" extension also applies to signatures appearing in certificates. Clients which desire the server to authenticate itself via a certificate MUST send the \"signature_algorithms\" extension. If a server is authenticating via a certificate and the client has not sent a \"signature_algorithms\" extension, then the server MUST abort the handshake with a \"missing_extension\" alert (seeSection 9.2). The \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension was added to allow implementations which supported different sets of algorithms for certificates and in TLS itself to clearly signal their capabilities. TLS 1.2 implementations SHOULD also process the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension. Implementations which have the same policy in both cases MAY omit the \"signature_algorithms_cert\" extension. The \"extension_data\" field of these extensions contains a SignatureSchemeList value. The SignatureScheme enum includes various signature algorithms such as RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms, ECDSA algorithms, RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID rsaEncryption, EdDSA algorithms, RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID RSASSA-PSS, legacy algorithms, and reserved code points. The SignatureSchemeList structure contains a list of supported signature algorithms. Note: This enum is named \"SignatureScheme\" because there is already a \"SignatureAlgorithm\" type in TLS 1.2, which this replaces. We use the term \"signature algorithm\" throughout the text. Each SignatureScheme value lists a single signature algorithm that the client is willing to verify. The signature algorithm values are indicated in descending order of preference. Note that a signature algorithm takes as input an arbitrary-length message, rather than a digest. Algorithms which traditionally act on a digest should be defined in TLS to first hash the input with a specified hash algorithm and then proceed as usual. The code point groups have the following meanings: RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms indicate a signature algorithm using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 with the corresponding hash algorithm. The RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithm values refer solely to signatures which appear in certificates and are not defined for use in signed TLS handshake messages, although they may appear in signature algorithm extensions for backward compatibility with TLS 1.2. ECDSA algorithms indicate a signature algorithm using ECDSA, the corresponding curve, and the corresponding hash algorithm. The signature is represented as a DER-encoded ECDSA-Sig-Value structure. RSASSA-PSS RSAE algorithms indicate a signature algorithm using RSASSA-PSS with mask generation function 1. The digest used in the mask generation function and the digest being signed are both the corresponding hash algorithm. The length of the Salt MUST be equal to the length of the output of the digest algorithm. If the public key is carried in an X.509 certificate, the public key MUST use the rsaEncryption OID. EdDSA algorithms indicate a signature algorithm using EdDSA or its successors. Note that these correspond to the \"PureEdDSA\" algorithms and not the \"prehash\" variants. RSASSA-PSS PSS algorithms indicate a signature algorithm using RSASSA-PSS with mask generation function 1. The digest used in the mask generation function and the digest being signed are both the corresponding hash algorithm. The length of the Salt MUST be equal to the length of the output of the digest algorithm. If the public key is carried in an X.509 certificate, the public key MUST use the RSASSA-PSS OID. When used in certificate signatures, the algorithm parameters MUST be DER encoded. If the corresponding public key's parameters are present, then the parameters in the signature MUST be identical to those in the public key. Legacy algorithms indicate algorithms which are being deprecated because they use algorithms with known weaknesses, specifically SHA-1 which is used with either RSA using RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 or ECDSA. The legacy algorithm values refer solely to signatures which appear in certificates and are not defined for use in signed TLS handshake messages, although they may appear in signature algorithm extensions for backward compatibility with TLS 1.2. Endpoints SHOULD NOT negotiate these algorithms but are permitted to do so solely for backward compatibility. Clients offering these values MUST list them as the lowest priority (listed after all other algorithms in SignatureSchemeList). TLS 1.3 servers MUST NOT offer a SHA-1 signed certificate unless no valid certificate chain can be produced without it (see Section 4.4.2.2). The signatures on certificates that are self-signed or certificates that are trust anchors are not validated, since they begin a certification path. A certificate that begins a certification path MAY use a signature algorithm that is not advertised as being supported in the \"signature_algorithms\" extension. Note that TLS 1.2 defines the signature algorithm extension differently. TLS 1.3 implementations willing to negotiate TLS 1.2 MUST behave in accordance with the requirements of TLS 1.2 when negotiating that version. In particular: TLS 1.2 ClientHellos MAY omit the signature algorithm extension. In TLS 1.2, the signature algorithm extension contained hash/signature pairs. The pairs are encoded in two octets, so SignatureScheme values have been allocated to align with TLS 1.2's encoding. Some legacy pairs are left unallocated. The unallocated legacy algorithms are deprecated as of TLS 1.3. The deprecated algorithms MUST NOT be offered or negotiated by any implementation. In particular, MD5, SHA-224, and DSA MUST NOT be used. ECDSA signature schemes align with TLS 1.2's ECDSA hash/signature pairs. However, the old semantics did not constrain the signing curve. If TLS 1.2 is negotiated, implementations MUST be prepared to accept a signature that uses any curve that they advertised in the \"supported_groups\" extension. Implementations that advertise support for RSASSA-PSS MUST be prepared to accept a signature using that scheme even when TLS 1.2 is negotiated. In TLS 1.2, RSASSA-PSS is used with RSA cipher suites.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.4. Finished": "The Finished message is the final message in the Authentication Block. The Finished message is essential for providing authentication of the handshake and of the computed keys. Recipients of Finished messages MUST verify that the contents are correct and if incorrect MUST terminate the connection with a \"decrypt_error\" alert. Once a side has sent its Finished message and has received and validated the Finished message from its peer, that side may begin to send and receive Application Data over the connection. There are two settings in which sending data prior to receiving the peer's Finished message is permitted: 1. Clients sending 0-RTT data as described in Section 4.2.10. 2. Servers MAY send data after sending their first flight, but because the handshake is not yet complete, servers have no assurance of either the peer's identity or its liveness (i.e., the ClientHello might have been replayed). The key used to compute the Finished message is computed from the Base Key defined in Section 4.4 using HKDF (see Section 7.1). Specifically, the finished_key is computed as HKDF-Expand-Label(BaseKey, \"finished\", \"\", Hash.length). The structure of this message is: struct { opaque verify_data[Hash.length]; } Finished. The verify_data value is computed as follows: verify_data = HMAC(finished_key, Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate*, CertificateVerify*)), where * indicates only included if present. HMAC [RFC2104] uses the Hash algorithm for the handshake. As noted above, the HMAC input can generally be implemented by a running hash, i.e., just the handshake hash at this point. In previous versions of TLS, the verify_data was always 12 octets long. In TLS 1.3, the verify_data is the size of the HMAC output for the Hash used for the handshake. Note: Alerts and any other non-handshake record types are not handshake messages and are not included in the hash computations. Any records following a Finished message MUST be encrypted under the appropriate application traffic key as described in Section 7.2. In particular, this requirement includes any alerts sent by the server in response to client Certificate and CertificateVerify messages.",
  "5. Record Protocol -> 5.5. Limits on Key Usage": "There are cryptographic limits on the amount of plaintext which can be safely encrypted under a given set of keys. [AEAD-LIMITS] provides an analysis of these limits under the assumption that the underlying primitive (AES or ChaCha20) has no weaknesses. Implementations SHOULD do a key update as described in Section 4.6.3 prior to reaching these limits. For AES-GCM, up to 2^24.5 full-size records (about 24 million) may be encrypted on a given connection while keeping a safety margin of approximately 2^-57 for Authenticated Encryption (AE) security. For ChaCha20/Poly1305, the record sequence number would wrap before the safety limit is reached.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.6. Post-Handshake Messages -> 4.6.3. Key and Initialization Vector Update": "The KeyUpdate handshake message is used to indicate that the sender is updating its sending cryptographic keys. The KeyUpdate message can be sent by either peer after the peer has sent a Finished message. Implementations that receive a KeyUpdate message prior to receiving a Finished message MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. After sending a KeyUpdate message, the sender SHALL send all its traffic using the next generation of keys, computed as described in Section 7.2. Upon receiving a KeyUpdate, the receiver MUST update its receiving keys. The KeyUpdateRequest enumeration defines values update_not_requested(0) and update_requested(1). The KeyUpdate structure contains a request_update field that indicates whether the recipient of the KeyUpdate should respond with its own KeyUpdate. If an implementation receives any other value for request_update, the implementation MUST terminate the connection with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. If the request_update field is set to \"update_requested\", then the receiver MUST send a KeyUpdate of its own with request_update set to \"update_not_requested\" prior to sending its next Application Data record. This mechanism allows either side to force an update to the entire connection, but causes an implementation which receives multiple KeyUpdates while the implementation is silent to respond with a single update. Note that implementations may receive an arbitrary number of messages between sending a KeyUpdate with request_update set to \"update_requested\" and receiving the peer's KeyUpdate, because those messages may already be in flight. However, because send and receive keys are derived from independent traffic secrets, retaining the receive traffic secret does not threaten the forward secrecy of data sent before the sender changed keys. If implementations independently send their own KeyUpdates with request_update set to \"update_requested\" and the KeyUpdates cross in flight, then each side will also send a response, with the result that each side increments by two generations. Both sender and receiver MUST encrypt their KeyUpdate messages with the old keys. Additionally, both sides MUST enforce that a KeyUpdate with the old key is received before accepting any messages encrypted with the new key. Failure to do so may allow message truncation attacks.",
  "5. Record Protocol": "The TLS record protocol takes messages to be transmitted, fragments the data into manageable blocks, protects the records, and transmits the result. Received data is verified, decrypted, reassembled, and then delivered to higher-level clients. TLS records are typed, which allows multiple higher-level protocols to be multiplexed over the same record layer. This document specifies four content types: handshake, application_data, alert, and change_cipher_spec. The change_cipher_spec record is used only for compatibility purposes (see Appendix D.4). An implementation may receive an unencrypted record of type change_cipher_spec consisting of the single byte value 0x01 at any time after the first ClientHello message has been sent or received and before the peer's Finished message has been received and MUST simply drop the change_cipher_spec record without further processing. Note that the change_cipher_spec record may appear at a point in the handshake where the implementation is expecting protected records, and so it is necessary to detect this condition prior to attempting to deprotect the record. An implementation which receives any other change_cipher_spec value or which receives a protected change_cipher_spec record MUST abort the handshake with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. If an implementation detects a change_cipher_spec record received before the first ClientHello message or after the peer's Finished message, the change_cipher_spec record MUST be treated as an unexpected record type (though stateless servers may not be able to distinguish these cases from allowed cases). Implementations MUST NOT send record types not defined in this document unless negotiated by some extension. If a TLS implementation receives an unexpected record type, the TLS implementation MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. New record content type values are assigned by IANA in the TLS ContentType registry as described in Section 11.",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations": "The TLS handshake establishes one or more input secrets which are combined to create the actual working keying material, as detailed below. The key derivation process incorporates both the input secrets and the handshake transcript. Note that because the handshake transcript includes the random values from the Hello messages, any given handshake will have different traffic secrets, even if the same input secrets are used, as is the case when the same PSK is used for multiple connections.",
  "5. Record Protocol -> 5.3. Per-Record Nonce": "A 64-bit sequence number is maintained separately for reading and writing records. The appropriate sequence number is incremented by one after reading or writing each record. Each sequence number is set to zero at the beginning of a connection and whenever the key is changed; the first record transmitted under a particular traffic key MUST use sequence number 0. Because the size of sequence numbers is 64-bit, the sequence numbers should not wrap. If a TLS implementation would need to wrap a sequence number, the TLS implementation MUST either rekey (Section 4.6.3) or terminate the connection. Each AEAD algorithm will specify a range of possible lengths for the per-record nonce, from N_MIN bytes to N_MAX bytes of input [RFC5116]. The length of the TLS per-record nonce (iv_length) is set to the larger of 8 bytes and N_MIN for the AEAD algorithm (see RFC5116, Section 4). An AEAD algorithm where N_MAX is less than 8 bytes MUST NOT be used with TLS. The per-record nonce for the AEAD construction is formed as follows: Step 1. The 64-bit record sequence number is encoded in network byte order and padded to the left with zeros to iv_length. Step 2. The padded sequence number is XORed with either the static client_write_iv or server_write_iv (depending on the role). The resulting quantity (of length iv_length) is used as the per-record nonce. Note: This per-record nonce construction is different from that in TLS 1.2, which specified a partially explicit nonce.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.4. Authentication Messages -> 4.4.3. Certificate Verify": "This message is used to provide explicit proof that an endpoint possesses the private key corresponding to its certificate. The CertificateVerify message also provides integrity for the handshake up to this point. Servers MUST send this message when authenticating via a certificate. Clients MUST send this message whenever authenticating via a certificate (i.e., when the Certificate message is non-empty). When sent, this message MUST appear immediately after the Certificate message and immediately prior to the Finished message. The structure of the CertificateVerify message is: struct { SignatureScheme algorithm; opaque signature<0..2^16-1>; } CertificateVerify. The algorithm field specifies the signature algorithm used (see Section 4.2.3 for the definition of this type). The signature is a digital signature using that algorithm. The content covered under the signature is the hash output as described in Section 4.4.1, namely: Transcript-Hash(Handshake Context, Certificate). The digital signature is then computed over the concatenation of: a string that consists of octet 32 (0x20) repeated 64 times, the context string, a single 0 byte which serves as the separator, and the content to be signed. This structure is intended to prevent an attack on previous versions of TLS in which the ServerKeyExchange format meant that attackers could obtain a signature of a message with a chosen 32-byte prefix (ClientHello.random). The initial 64-byte pad clears that prefix along with the server-controlled ServerHello.random. The context string for a server signature is \"TLS 1.3, server CertificateVerify\". The context string for a client signature is \"TLS 1.3, client CertificateVerify\". The context string is used to provide separation between signatures made in different contexts, helping against potential cross-protocol attacks. For example, if the transcript hash was 32 bytes of 01 (this length would make sense for SHA-256), the content covered by the digital signature for a server CertificateVerify would be: 2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020 2020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020202020 544c5320312e332c207365727665722043657274696669636174655665726966 79 00 0101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101010101. On the sender side, the process for computing the signature field of the CertificateVerify message takes as input: the content covered by the digital signature, and the private signing key corresponding to the certificate sent in the previous message. If the CertificateVerify message is sent by a server, the signature algorithm MUST be one offered in the client's \"signature_algorithms\" extension unless no valid certificate chain can be produced without unsupported algorithms (see Section 4.2.3). If sent by a client, the signature algorithm used in the signature MUST be one of those present in the supported_signature_algorithms field of the \"signature_algorithms\" extension in the CertificateRequest message. In addition, the signature algorithm MUST be compatible with the key in the sender's end-entity certificate. RSA signatures MUST use an RSASSA-PSS algorithm, regardless of whether RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5 algorithms appear in \"signature_algorithms\". The SHA-1 algorithm MUST NOT be used in any signatures of CertificateVerify messages. All SHA-1 signature algorithms in this specification are defined solely for use in legacy certificates and are not valid for CertificateVerify signatures. The receiver of a CertificateVerify message MUST verify the signature field. The verification process takes as input: the content covered by the digital signature, the public key contained in the end-entity certificate found in the associated Certificate message, and the digital signature received in the signature field of the CertificateVerify message. If the verification fails, the receiver MUST terminate the handshake with a \"decrypt_error\" alert.",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.4. (EC)DHE Shared Secret Calculation -> 7.4.1. Finite Field Diffie-Hellman": "For finite field groups, a conventional Diffie-Hellman [DH76] computation is performed. The negotiated key (Z) is converted to a byte string by encoding in big-endian form and left-padded with zeros up to the size of the prime. This byte string is used as the shared secret in the key schedule as specified above. Note that this construction differs from previous versions of TLS which removed leading zeros.",
  "5. Record Protocol -> 5.4. Record Padding": "All encrypted TLS records can be padded to inflate the size of the TLSCiphertext. This allows the sender to hide the size of the traffic from an observer. When generating a TLSCiphertext record, implementations MAY choose to pad. An unpadded record is just a record with a padding length of zero. Padding is a string of zero-valued bytes appended to the ContentType field before encryption. Implementations MUST set the padding octets to all zeros before encrypting. Application Data records may contain a zero-length TLSInnerPlaintext.content if the sender desires. This permits generation of plausibly sized cover traffic in contexts where the presence or absence of activity may be sensitive. Implementations MUST NOT send Handshake and Alert records that have a zero-length TLSInnerPlaintext.content; if such a message is received, the receiving implementation MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. The padding sent is automatically verified by the record protection mechanism; upon successful decryption of a TLSCiphertext.encrypted_record, the receiving implementation scans the field from the end toward the beginning until it finds a non-zero octet. This non-zero octet is the content type of the message. This padding scheme was selected because it allows padding of any encrypted TLS record by an arbitrary size (from zero up to TLS record size limits) without introducing new content types. The design also enforces all-zero padding octets, which allows for quick detection of padding errors. Implementations MUST limit their scanning to the cleartext returned from the AEAD decryption. If a receiving implementation does not find a non-zero octet in the cleartext, it MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. The presence of padding does not change the overall record size limitations: the full encoded TLSInnerPlaintext MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1 octets. If the maximum fragment length is reduced -- as, for example, by the record_size_limit extension from [RFC8449] -- then the reduced limit applies to the full plaintext, including the content type and padding. Selecting a padding policy that suggests when and how much to pad is a complex topic and is beyond the scope of this specification. If the application-layer protocol on top of TLS has its own padding, it may be preferable to pad Application Data TLS records within the application layer. Padding for encrypted Handshake or Alert records must still be handled at the TLS layer, though. Later documents may define padding selection algorithms or define a padding policy request mechanism through TLS extensions or some other means.",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.2. Updating Traffic Secrets": "Once the handshake is complete, it is possible for either side to update its sending traffic keys using the KeyUpdate handshake message defined in Section 4.6.3. The next generation of traffic keys is computed by generating client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 from client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N as described in this section and then re-deriving the traffic keys as described in Section 7.3. The next-generation application_traffic_secret is computed as: application_traffic_secret_N+1 = HKDF-Expand-Label(application_traffic_secret_N, \"traffic upd\", \"\", Hash.length). Once client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N+1 and its associated traffic keys have been computed, implementations SHOULD delete client_/server_application_traffic_secret_N and its associated traffic keys.",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.3. Traffic Key Calculation": "The traffic keying material is generated from the following input values: a secret value, a purpose value indicating the specific value being generated, and the length of the key being generated. The traffic keying material is generated from an input traffic secret value using: [sender]_write_key = HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, \"key\", \"\", key_length) and [sender]_write_iv = HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, \"iv\", \"\", iv_length). [sender] denotes the sending side. The value of Secret for each record type is shown in the table below. The value of Secret for each record type is: for 0-RTT Application, client_early_traffic_secret; for Handshake, [sender]_handshake_traffic_secret; for Application Data, [sender]_application_traffic_secret_N. All the traffic keying material is recomputed whenever the underlying Secret changes, such as when changing from the handshake to Application Data keys or upon a key update.",
  "6. Alert Protocol -> 6.1. Closure Alerts": "The client and the server must share knowledge that the connection is ending in order to avoid a truncation attack. close_notify: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender will not send any more messages on this connection. Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored. user_canceled: This alert notifies the recipient that the sender is canceling the handshake for some reason unrelated to a protocol failure. If a user cancels an operation after the handshake is complete, just closing the connection by sending a \"close_notify\" is more appropriate. The user_canceled alert SHOULD be followed by a \"close_notify\". The user_canceled alert generally has AlertLevel=warning. Either party MAY initiate a close of its write side of the connection by sending a \"close_notify\" alert. Any data received after a closure alert has been received MUST be ignored. If a transport-level close is received prior to a \"close_notify\", the receiver cannot know that all the data that was sent has been received. Each party MUST send a \"close_notify\" alert before closing its write side of the connection, unless it has already sent some error alert. Sending a \"close_notify\" alert does not have any effect on its read side of the connection. Note that this requirement is a change from versions of TLS prior to TLS 1.3 in which implementations were required to react to a \"close_notify\" by discarding pending writes and sending an immediate \"close_notify\" alert of their own. The previous requirement to react immediately to a \"close_notify\" could cause truncation in the read side. Both parties need not wait to receive a \"close_notify\" alert before closing their read side of the connection, though doing so would introduce the possibility of truncation. If the application protocol using TLS provides that any data may be carried over the underlying transport after the TLS connection is closed, the TLS implementation MUST receive a \"close_notify\" alert before indicating end-of-data to the application layer. No part of this standard should be taken to dictate the manner in which a usage profile for TLS manages its data transport, including when connections are opened or closed. Note: It is assumed that closing the write side of a connection reliably delivers pending data before destroying the transport.",
  "6. Alert Protocol": "TLS provides an Alert content type to indicate closure information and errors. Like other messages, alert messages are encrypted as specified by the current connection state. Alert messages convey a description of the alert and a legacy field that conveyed the severity level of the message in previous versions of TLS. Alerts are divided into two classes: closure alerts and error alerts. In TLS 1.3, the severity is implicit in the type of alert being sent, and the \"level\" field can safely be ignored. The \"close_notify\" alert is used to indicate orderly closure of one direction of the connection. Upon receiving a close_notify alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate end-of-data to the application. Error alerts indicate abortive closure of the connection (see Section 6.2). Upon receiving an error alert, the TLS implementation SHOULD indicate an error to the application and MUST NOT allow any further data to be sent or received on the connection. Servers and clients MUST forget the secret values and keys established in failed connections, with the exception of the PSKs associated with session tickets, which SHOULD be discarded if possible. All the alerts listed in Section 6.2 MUST be sent with AlertLevel=fatal and MUST be treated as error alerts when received regardless of the AlertLevel in the message. Unknown Alert types MUST be treated as error alerts. Note: TLS defines two generic alerts (see Section 6) to use upon failure to parse a message. Peers which receive a message which cannot be parsed according to the syntax (e.g., have a length extending beyond the message boundary or contain an out-of-range length) MUST terminate the connection with a \"decode_error\" alert. Peers which receive a message which is syntactically correct but semantically invalid (e.g., a DHE share of p - 1, or an invalid enum) MUST terminate the connection with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert. The AlertLevel enumeration defines warning(1) and fatal(2) values. The AlertDescription enumeration includes various alert types such as close_notify(0), unexpected_message(10), bad_record_mac(20), record_overflow(22), handshake_failure(40), bad_certificate(42), unsupported_certificate(43), certificate_revoked(44), certificate_expired(45), certificate_unknown(46), illegal_parameter(47), unknown_ca(48), access_denied(49), decode_error(50), decrypt_error(51), protocol_version(70), insufficient_security(71), internal_error(80), inappropriate_fallback(86), user_canceled(90), missing_extension(109), unsupported_extension(110), unrecognized_name(112), bad_certificate_status_response(113), unknown_psk_identity(115), certificate_required(116), and no_application_protocol(120). The Alert structure consists of an AlertLevel level field and an AlertDescription description field.",
  "5. Record Protocol -> 5.1. Record Layer": "The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Message boundaries are handled differently depending on the underlying ContentType. Any future content types MUST specify appropriate rules. Note that these rules are stricter than what was enforced in TLS 1.2. Handshake messages MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record or fragmented across several records, provided that: Handshake messages MUST NOT be interleaved with other record types. That is, if a handshake message is split over two or more records, there MUST NOT be any other records between them. Handshake messages MUST NOT span key changes. Implementations MUST verify that all messages immediately preceding a key change align with a record boundary; if not, then implementations MUST terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. Because the ClientHello, EndOfEarlyData, ServerHello, Finished, and KeyUpdate messages can immediately precede a key change, implementations MUST send these messages in alignment with a record boundary. Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake types, even if those fragments contain padding. Alert messages (Section 6) MUST NOT be fragmented across records, and multiple alert messages MUST NOT be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record. In other words, a record with an Alert type MUST contain exactly one message. Application Data messages contain data that is opaque to TLS. Application Data messages are always protected. Zero-length fragments of Application Data MAY be sent, as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis countermeasure. Application Data fragments MAY be split across multiple records or coalesced into a single record. ContentType is an enumeration with values: invalid(0), change_cipher_spec(20), alert(21), handshake(22), application_data(23), and (255). TLSPlaintext is a structure containing: type, which is the higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment; legacy_record_version; length; and fragment. legacy_record_version MUST be set to 0x0303 for all records generated by a TLS 1.3 implementation other than an initial ClientHello, which is one not generated after a HelloRetryRequest, where legacy_record_version MAY also be 0x0301 for compatibility purposes. The legacy_record_version field is deprecated and MUST be ignored for all purposes. Previous versions of TLS would use other values in the legacy_record_version field under some circumstances. length: The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 bytes. An endpoint that receives a record that exceeds this length MUST terminate the connection with a \"record_overflow\" alert. fragment: The data being transmitted. The fragment value is transparent and is treated as an independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified by the type field. This document describes TLS 1.3, which uses the version 0x0304. The version value 0x0304 is historical, deriving from the use of 0x0301 for TLS 1.0 and 0x0300 for SSL 3.0. In order to maximize backward compatibility, a record containing an initial ClientHello SHOULD have legacy_record_version 0x0301, reflecting TLS 1.0, and a record containing a second ClientHello or a ServerHello MUST have legacy_record_version 0x0303, reflecting TLS 1.2. When negotiating prior versions of TLS, endpoints follow the procedure and requirements provided in Appendix D. When record protection has not yet been engaged, TLSPlaintext structures are written directly onto the wire. Once record protection has started, TLSPlaintext records are protected and sent as described in the following section. Note that Application Data records MUST NOT be written to the wire unprotected (see Section 2 for details).",
  "8. 0-RTT and Anti-Replay -> 8.1. Single-Use Tickets": "The simplest form of anti-replay defense is for the server to only allow each session ticket to be used once. For instance, the server can maintain a database of all outstanding valid tickets, deleting each ticket from the database as the ticket is used. If an unknown ticket is provided, the server would then fall back to a full handshake. If the tickets are not self-contained but rather are database keys, and the corresponding PSKs are deleted upon use, then connections established using PSKs enjoy forward secrecy. This mechanism improves security for all 0-RTT data and PSK usage when PSK is used without (EC)DHE. Because this mechanism requires sharing the session database between server nodes in environments with multiple distributed servers, it may be hard to achieve high rates of successful PSK 0-RTT connections when compared to self-encrypted tickets. Unlike session databases, session tickets can successfully do PSK-based session establishment even without consistent storage, though when 0-RTT is allowed session tickets still require consistent storage for anti-replay of 0-RTT data, as detailed in the following section.",

Mandatory-to-Implement Cipher Suites": "In the absence of an application profile standard specifying otherwise: A TLS-compliant application MUST implement the TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 cipher suite and SHOULD implement the TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384 and TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256 cipher suites (see Appendix B.4). A TLS-compliant application MUST support digital signatures with rsa_pkcs1_sha256 (for certificates), rsa_pss_rsae_sha256 (for CertificateVerify and certificates), and ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256.

  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.4. (EC)DHE Shared Secret Calculation -> 7.4.2. Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman": "For secp256r1, secp384r1, and secp521r1, ECDH calculations (including parameter and key generation as well as the shared secret calculation) are performed according to [IEEE1363] using the ECKAS-DH1 scheme with the identity map as the key derivation function (KDF), so that the shared secret is the x-coordinate of the ECDH shared secret elliptic curve point represented as an octet string. Note that this octet string (\"Z\" in IEEE 1363 terminology) as output by FE2OSP (the Field Element to Octet String Conversion Primitive) has constant length for any given field; leading zeros found in this octet string MUST NOT be truncated. (Note that this use of the identity KDF is a technicality. The complete picture is that ECDH is employed with a non-trivial KDF because TLS does not directly use the shared secret for anything other than for computing other secrets. For X25519 and X448, the ECDH calculations are as follows: The public key to put into the KeyShareEntry.key_exchange structure is the result of applying the ECDH scalar multiplication function to the secret key of appropriate length (into scalar input) and the standard public basepoint (into u-coordinate point input). The ECDH shared secret is the result of applying the ECDH scalar multiplication function to the secret key (into scalar input) and the peer's public key (into u-coordinate point input). The output is used raw, with no processing. For these curves, implementations SHOULD use the approach specified in [RFC7748] to calculate the Diffie-Hellman shared secret. Implementations MUST check whether the computed Diffie-Hellman shared secret is the all-zero value and abort if so, as described in [Section 6 of [RFC7748]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748#section-6). If implementors use an alternative implementation of these elliptic curves, they SHOULD perform the additional checks specified in [Section 7 of [RFC7748]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748#section-7).",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.5. Exporters": "[RFC5705] defines keying material exporters for TLS in terms of the TLS pseudorandom function (PRF). This document replaces the PRF with HKDF, thus requiring a new construction. The exporter interface remains the same. The exporter value is computed as: TLS-Exporter(label, context_value, key_length) = HKDF-Expand-Label(Derive-Secret(Secret, label, \"\"), \"exporter\", Hash(context_value), key_length) where Secret is either the early_exporter_master_secret or the exporter_master_secret. Implementations MUST use the exporter_master_secret unless explicitly specified by the application. The early_exporter_master_secret is defined for use in settings where an exporter is needed for 0-RTT data. A separate interface for the early exporter is RECOMMENDED; this avoids the exporter user accidentally using an early exporter when a regular one is desired or vice versa. If no context is provided, the context_value is zero length. Consequently, providing no context computes the same value as providing an empty context. This is a change from previous versions of TLS where an empty context produced a different output than an absent context. As of this document's publication, no allocated exporter label is used both with and without a context. Future specifications MUST NOT define a use of exporters that permit both an empty context and no context with the same label. New uses of exporters SHOULD provide a context in all exporter computations, though the value could be empty. Requirements for the format of exporter labels are defined in Section 4 of RFC5705.",
  "10. Security Considerations": "Security issues are discussed throughout this memo, especially in Appendices C, D, and E.",
  "4. Handshake Protocol -> 4.6. Post-Handshake Messages -> 4.6.1. New Session Ticket Message": "At any time after the server has received the client Finished message, the server MAY send a NewSessionTicket message. The NewSessionTicket message creates a unique association between the ticket value and a secret PSK derived from the resumption master secret (see Section 7). The client MAY use the PSK derived from the ticket for future handshakes by including the ticket value in the \"pre_shared_key\" extension in its ClientHello (Section 4.2.11). Servers MAY send multiple tickets on a single connection, either immediately after each other or after specific events (see Appendix C.4). For instance, the server might send a new ticket after post-handshake authentication in order to encapsulate the additional client authentication state. Multiple tickets are useful for clients for a variety of purposes, including opening multiple parallel HTTP connections. Performing connection racing across interfaces and address families via (for example) Happy Eyeballs [RFC8305] or related techniques. Any ticket MUST only be resumed with a cipher suite that has the same KDF hash algorithm as that used to establish the original connection. Clients MUST only resume if the new SNI value is valid for the server certificate presented in the original session and SHOULD only resume if the SNI value matches the one used in the original session. The requirement to match the SNI value is a performance optimization: normally, there is no reason to expect that different servers covered by a single certificate would be able to accept each other's tickets; hence, attempting resumption in that case would waste a single-use ticket. If an indication is provided that different servers covered by a single certificate can accept each other's tickets (externally or by any other means), clients MAY resume with a different SNI value. On resumption, if reporting an SNI value to the calling application, implementations MUST use the value sent in the resumption ClientHello rather than the value sent in the previous session. Note that if a server implementation declines all PSK identities with different SNI values, these two values are always the same. Although the resumption master secret depends on the client's second flight, a server which does not request client authentication MAY compute the remainder of the transcript independently and then send a NewSessionTicket immediately upon sending its Finished rather than waiting for the client Finished. Sending NewSessionTicket immediately might be appropriate in cases where the client is expected to open multiple TLS connections in parallel and would benefit from the reduced overhead of a resumption handshake, for example. The NewSessionTicket structure contains: ticket_lifetime indicates the lifetime in seconds as a 32-bit unsigned integer in network byte order from the time of ticket issuance. Servers MUST NOT use any value greater than 604800 seconds (7 days). The value of zero indicates that the ticket should be discarded immediately. Clients MUST NOT cache tickets for longer than 7 days, regardless of the ticket_lifetime, and MAY delete tickets earlier based on local policy. A server MAY treat a ticket as valid for a shorter period of time than what is stated in the ticket_lifetime. ticket_age_add is a securely generated, random 32-bit value that is used to obscure the age of the ticket that the client includes in the \"pre_shared_key\" extension. The client-side ticket age is added to this value modulo 2^32 to obtain the value that is transmitted by the client. The server MUST generate a fresh value for each ticket it sends. ticket_nonce is a per-ticket value that is unique across all tickets issued on this connection. ticket is the value of the ticket to be used as the PSK identity. The ticket itself is an opaque label. The ticket MAY be either a database lookup key or a self-encrypted and self-authenticated value. extensions is a set of extension values for the ticket. The \"Extension\" format is defined in Section 4.2. Clients MUST ignore unrecognized extensions. The sole extension currently defined for NewSessionTicket is \"early_data\", indicating that the ticket may be used to send 0-RTT data (Section 4.2.10). The early_data extension contains the following value: max_early_data_size is the maximum amount of 0-RTT data that the client is allowed to send when using this ticket, in bytes. Only Application Data payload (i.e., plaintext but not padding or the inner content type byte) is counted. A server receiving more than max_early_data_size bytes of 0-RTT data SHOULD terminate the connection with an \"unexpected_message\" alert. Note that servers that reject early data due to lack of cryptographic material will be unable to differentiate padding from content, so clients SHOULD NOT depend on being able to send large quantities of padding in early data records. The PSK associated with the ticket is computed as HKDF-Expand-Label(resumption_master_secret, \"resumption\", ticket_nonce, Hash.length). Because the ticket_nonce value is distinct for each NewSessionTicket message, a different PSK will be derived for each ticket. Note that in principle it is possible to continue issuing new tickets which indefinitely extend the lifetime of the keying material originally derived from an initial non-PSK handshake (which was most likely tied to the peer's certificate). It is RECOMMENDED that implementations place limits on the total lifetime of keying material derived from an initial non-PSK handshake; these limits should take into account the lifetime of the peer's certificate, the likelihood of intervening revocation, and the time since the peer's online CertificateVerify signature.",
  "5. Record Protocol -> 5.2. Record Payload Protection": "The record protection functions translate a TLSPlaintext structure into a TLSCiphertext structure. The deprotection functions reverse the process. In TLS 1.3, as opposed to previous versions of TLS, all ciphers are modeled as \"Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data\" (AEAD) [RFC5116]. AEAD functions provide a unified encryption and authentication operation which turns plaintext into authenticated ciphertext and back again. Each encrypted record consists of a plaintext header followed by an encrypted body, which itself contains a type and optional padding. The TLSInnerPlaintext structure contains content, type, and zeros fields. The TLSCiphertext structure contains opaque_type, legacy_record_version, length, and encrypted_record fields. The content field contains the TLSPlaintext.fragment value, which holds the byte encoding of a handshake or an alert message, or the raw bytes of the application's data to send. The type field contains the TLSPlaintext.type value, which specifies the content type of the record. The zeros field is an arbitrary-length run of zero-valued bytes that may appear in the cleartext after the type field. The zeros field provides an opportunity for senders to pad any TLS record by a chosen amount as long as the total stays within record size limits. See Section 5.4 for more details. The opaque_type field of a TLSCiphertext record is always set to the value 23 (application_data) for outward compatibility with middleboxes accustomed to parsing previous versions of TLS. The actual content type of the record is found in TLSInnerPlaintext.type after decryption. The legacy_record_version field is always 0x0303. TLS 1.3 TLSCiphertexts are not generated until after TLS 1.3 has been negotiated, so there are no historical compatibility concerns where other values might be received. Note that the handshake protocol, including the ClientHello and ServerHello messages, authenticates the protocol version, so the legacy_record_version field is redundant. The length field specifies the length in bytes of the following TLSCiphertext.encrypted_record, which is the sum of the lengths of the content and the padding, plus one for the inner content type, plus any expansion added by the AEAD algorithm. The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 256 bytes. An endpoint that receives a record that exceeds this length MUST terminate the connection with a \"record_overflow\" alert. The encrypted_record field contains the AEAD-encrypted form of the serialized TLSInnerPlaintext structure. AEAD algorithms take as input a single key, a nonce, a plaintext, and \"additional data\" to be included in the authentication check, as described in [Section 2.1 of [RFC5116]](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5116#section-2.1). The key is either the client_write_key or the server_write_key, the nonce is derived from the sequence number and the client_write_iv or server_write_iv (see Section 5.3), and the additional data input is the record header. The additional data is TLSCiphertext.opaque_type concatenated with TLSCiphertext.legacy_record_version and TLSCiphertext.length. The plaintext input to the AEAD algorithm is the encoded TLSInnerPlaintext structure. Derivation of traffic keys is defined in Section 7.3. The AEAD output consists of the ciphertext output from the AEAD encryption operation. The length of the plaintext is greater than the corresponding TLSPlaintext.length due to the inclusion of TLSInnerPlaintext.type and any padding supplied by the sender. The length of the AEAD output will generally be larger than the plaintext, but by an amount that varies with the AEAD algorithm. Since the ciphers might incorporate padding, the amount of overhead could vary with different lengths of plaintext. Symbolically, AEADEncrypted = AEAD-Encrypt(write_key, nonce, additional_data, plaintext). The encrypted_record field of TLSCiphertext is set to AEADEncrypted. In order to decrypt and verify, the cipher takes as input the key, nonce, additional data, and the AEADEncrypted value. The output is either the plaintext or an error indicating that the decryption failed. There is no separate integrity check. Symbolically, plaintext of encrypted_record = AEAD-Decrypt(peer_write_key, nonce, additional_data, AEADEncrypted). If the decryption fails, the receiver MUST terminate the connection with a \"bad_record_mac\" alert. An AEAD algorithm used in TLS 1.3 MUST NOT produce an expansion greater than 255 octets. An endpoint that receives a record from its peer with TLSCiphertext.length larger than 2^14 + 256 octets MUST terminate the connection with a \"record_overflow\" alert. The 2^14 + 256 octets limit is derived from the maximum TLSInnerPlaintext length of 2^14 octets plus 1 octet for ContentType plus the maximum AEAD expansion of 255 octets.",
  "8. 0-RTT and Anti-Replay -> 8.3. Freshness Checks": "Because the ClientHello indicates the time at which the client sent the ClientHello, it is possible to efficiently determine whether a ClientHello was likely sent reasonably recently and only accept 0-RTT for such a ClientHello, otherwise falling back to a 1-RTT handshake. This freshness checking mechanism is necessary for the ClientHello storage mechanism described in Section 8.2 because otherwise the server needs to store an unlimited number of ClientHellos, and is a useful optimization for self-contained single-use tickets because the mechanism allows efficient rejection of ClientHellos which cannot be used for 0-RTT. In order to implement this mechanism, a server needs to store the time that the server generated the session ticket, offset by an estimate of the round-trip time between client and server. For example, adjusted_creation_time equals creation_time plus estimated_RTT. This value can be encoded in the ticket, thus avoiding the need to keep state for each outstanding ticket. The server can determine the client's view of the age of the ticket by subtracting the ticket's \"ticket_age_add\" value from the \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" parameter in the client's \"pre_shared_key\" extension. The server can determine the expected_arrival_time of the ClientHello as: expected_arrival_time equals adjusted_creation_time plus clients_ticket_age. When a new ClientHello is received, the expected_arrival_time is then compared against the current server wall clock time and if the times differ by more than a certain amount, 0-RTT is rejected, though the 1-RTT handshake can be allowed to complete. There are several potential sources of error that might cause mismatches between the expected_arrival_time and the measured time. Variations in client and server clock rates are likely to be minimal, though potentially the absolute times may be off by large values. Network propagation delays are the most likely causes of a mismatch in legitimate values for elapsed time. Both the NewSessionTicket and ClientHello messages might be retransmitted and therefore delayed, which might be hidden by TCP. For clients on the Internet, this freshness checking mechanism implies windows on the order of ten seconds to account for errors in clocks and variations in measurements; other deployment scenarios may have different needs. Clock skew distributions are not symmetric, so the optimal tradeoff may involve an asymmetric range of permissible mismatch values. Note that freshness checking alone is not sufficient to prevent replays because it does not detect them during the error window, which -- depending on bandwidth and system capacity -- could include billions of replays in real-world settings. In addition, this freshness checking is only done at the time the ClientHello is received and not when subsequent early Application Data records are received. After early data is accepted, records may continue to be streamed to the server over a longer time period.",
  "8. 0-RTT and Anti-Replay": "As noted in Section 2.3 and Appendix E.5, TLS does not provide inherent replay protections for 0-RTT data. There are two potential threats to be concerned with: Network attackers who mount a replay attack by simply duplicating a flight of 0-RTT data. Network attackers who take advantage of client retry behavior to arrange for the server to receive multiple copies of an application message. This threat already exists to some extent because clients that value robustness respond to network errors by attempting to retry requests. However, 0-RTT adds an additional dimension for any server system which does not maintain globally consistent server state. Specifically, if a server system has multiple zones where tickets from zone A will not be accepted in zone B, then an attacker can duplicate a ClientHello and early data intended for A to both A and B. At A, the data will be accepted in 0-RTT, but at B the server will reject 0-RTT data and instead force a full handshake. If the attacker blocks the ServerHello from A, then the client will complete the handshake with B and probably retry the request, leading to duplication on the server system as a whole. The first class of attack can be prevented by sharing state to guarantee that the 0-RTT data is accepted at most once. Servers SHOULD provide that level of replay safety by implementing one of the methods described in this section or by equivalent means. It is understood, however, that due to operational concerns not all deployments will maintain state at that level. Therefore, in normal operation, clients will not know which, if any, of these mechanisms servers actually implement and hence MUST only send early data which they deem safe to be replayed. In addition to the direct effects of replays, there is a class of attacks where even operations normally considered idempotent could be exploited by a large number of replays (timing attacks, resource limit exhaustion and others, as described in Appendix E.5). Those attacks can be mitigated by ensuring that every 0-RTT payload can be replayed only a limited number of times. The server MUST ensure that any instance of the server (be it a machine, a thread, or any other entity within the relevant serving infrastructure) would accept 0-RTT for the same 0-RTT handshake at most once; this limits the number of replays to the number of server instances in the deployment. Such a guarantee can be accomplished by locally recording data from recently received ClientHellos and rejecting repeats, or by any other method that provides the same or a stronger guarantee. The \"at most once per server instance\" guarantee is a minimum requirement; servers SHOULD limit 0-RTT replays further when feasible. The second class of attack cannot be prevented at the TLS layer and MUST be dealt with by any application. Note that any application whose clients implement any kind of retry behavior already needs to implement some sort of anti-replay defense.",
  "6. Alert Protocol -> 6.2. Error Alerts": "Error handling in TLS is very simple. When an error is detected, the detecting party sends a message to its peer. Upon transmission or receipt of a fatal alert message, both parties MUST immediately close the connection. Whenever an implementation encounters a fatal error condition, it SHOULD send an appropriate fatal alert and MUST close the connection without sending or receiving any additional data. In the rest of this specification, when the phrases \"terminate the connection\" and \"abort the handshake\" are used without a specific alert it means that the implementation SHOULD send the alert indicated by the descriptions below. The phrases \"terminate the connection with an X alert\" and \"abort the handshake with an X alert\" mean that the implementation MUST send alert X if it sends any alert. All alerts defined below in this section, as well as all unknown alerts, are universally considered fatal as of TLS 1.3 (see Section 6). The implementation SHOULD provide a way to facilitate logging the sending and receiving of alerts. The following error alerts are defined: unexpected_message: An inappropriate message (e.g., the wrong handshake message, premature Application Data, etc.) was received. The unexpected_message alert should never be observed in communication between proper implementations. bad_record_mac: This alert is returned if a record is received which cannot be deprotected. Because AEAD algorithms combine decryption and verification, and also to avoid side-channel attacks, the bad_record_mac alert is used for all deprotection failures. The bad_record_mac alert should never be observed in communication between proper implementations, except when messages were corrupted in the network. record_overflow: A TLSCiphertext record was received that had a length more than 2^14 + 256 bytes, or a record decrypted to a TLSPlaintext record with more than 2^14 bytes (or some other negotiated limit). The record_overflow alert should never be observed in communication between proper implementations, except when messages were corrupted in the network. handshake_failure: Receipt of a \"handshake_failure\" alert message indicates that the sender was unable to negotiate an acceptable set of security parameters given the options available. bad_certificate: A certificate was corrupt, contained signatures that did not verify correctly, etc. unsupported_certificate: A certificate was of an unsupported type. certificate_revoked: A certificate was revoked by its signer. certificate_expired: A certificate has expired or is not currently valid. certificate_unknown: Some other (unspecified) issue arose in processing the certificate, rendering it unacceptable. illegal_parameter: A field in the handshake was incorrect or inconsistent with other fields. The illegal_parameter alert is used for errors which conform to the formal protocol syntax but are otherwise incorrect. unknown_ca: A valid certificate chain or partial chain was received, but the certificate was not accepted because the CA certificate could not be located or could not be matched with a known trust anchor. access_denied: A valid certificate or PSK was received, but when access control was applied, the sender decided not to proceed with negotiation. decode_error: A message could not be decoded because some field was out of the specified range or the length of the message was incorrect. The decode_error alert is used for errors where the message does not conform to the formal protocol syntax. The decode_error alert should never be observed in communication between proper implementations, except when messages were corrupted in the network. decrypt_error: A handshake (not record layer) cryptographic operation failed, including being unable to correctly verify a signature or validate a Finished message or a PSK binder. protocol_version: The protocol version the peer has attempted to negotiate is recognized but not supported (see Appendix D). insufficient_security: Returned instead of \"handshake_failure\" when a negotiation has failed specifically because the server requires parameters more secure than those supported by the client. internal_error: An internal error unrelated to the peer or the correctness of the protocol (such as a memory allocation failure) makes it impossible to continue. inappropriate_fallback: Sent by a server in response to an invalid connection retry attempt from a client (see RFC7507 for Preventing Protocol Downgrade Attacks). missing_extension: Sent by endpoints that receive a handshake message not containing an extension that is mandatory to send for the offered TLS version or other negotiated parameters. unsupported_extension: Sent by endpoints receiving any handshake message containing an extension known to be prohibited for inclusion in the given handshake message, or including any extensions in a ServerHello or Certificate not first offered in the corresponding ClientHello or CertificateRequest. unrecognized_name: Sent by servers when no server exists identified by the name provided by the client via the \"server_name\" extension (see RFC6066 Extensions: Extension Definitions). bad_certificate_status_response: Sent by clients when an invalid or unacceptable OCSP response is provided by the server via the \"status_request\" extension (see RFC6066 Extensions: Extension Definitions). unknown_psk_identity: Sent by servers when PSK key establishment is desired but no acceptable PSK identity is provided by the client. Sending the unknown_psk_identity alert is OPTIONAL; servers MAY instead choose to send a \"decrypt_error\" alert to merely indicate an invalid PSK identity. certificate_required: Sent by servers when a client certificate is desired but none was provided by the client. no_application_protocol: Sent by servers when a client \"application_layer_protocol_negotiation\" extension advertises only protocols that the server does not support (see RFC7301 Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation Extension). New Alert values are assigned by IANA as described in Section 11.",
  "9. Compliance Requirements -> 9.2. Mandatory-to-Implement Extensions": "In the absence of an application profile standard specifying otherwise, a TLS-compliant application MUST implement the following TLS extensions: Supported Versions (\"supported_versions\"; Section 4.2.1), Cookie (\"cookie\"; Section 4.2.2), Signature Algorithms (\"signature_algorithms\"; Section 4.2.3), Signature Algorithms Certificate (\"signature_algorithms_cert\"; Section 4.2.3), Negotiated Groups (\"supported_groups\"; Section 4.2.7), Key Share (\"key_share\"; Section 4.2.8), and Server Name Indication (\"server_name\"; Section 3 of RFC6066). All implementations MUST send and use these extensions when offering applicable features: \"supported_versions\" is REQUIRED for all ClientHello, ServerHello, and HelloRetryRequest messages. \"signature_algorithms\" is REQUIRED for certificate authentication. \"supported_groups\" is REQUIRED for ClientHello messages using DHE or ECDHE key exchange. \"key_share\" is REQUIRED for DHE or ECDHE key exchange. \"pre_shared_key\" is REQUIRED for PSK key agreement. \"psk_key_exchange_modes\" is REQUIRED for PSK key agreement. A client is considered to be attempting to negotiate using this specification if the ClientHello contains a \"supported_versions\" extension with 0x0304 contained in its body. Such a ClientHello message MUST meet the following requirements: If not containing a \"pre_shared_key\" extension, it MUST contain both a \"signature_algorithms\" extension and a \"supported_groups\" extension. If containing a \"supported_groups\" extension, it MUST also contain a \"key_share\" extension, and vice versa. An empty KeyShare.client_shares vector is permitted. Servers receiving a ClientHello which does not conform to these requirements MUST abort the handshake with a \"missing_extension\" alert. Additionally, all implementations MUST support the use of the \"server_name\" extension with applications capable of using it. Servers MAY require clients to send a valid \"server_name\" extension. Servers requiring this extension SHOULD respond to a ClientHello lacking a \"server_name\" extension by terminating the connection with a \"missing_extension\" alert.",
  "8. 0-RTT and Anti-Replay -> 8.2. Client Hello Recording": "An alternative form of anti-replay is to record a unique value derived from the ClientHello (generally either the random value or the PSK binder) and reject duplicates. Recording all ClientHellos causes state to grow without bound, but a server can instead record ClientHellos within a given time window and use the \"obfuscated_ticket_age\" to ensure that tickets aren't reused outside that window. In order to implement this, when a ClientHello is received, the server first verifies the PSK binder as described in Section 4.2.11. The server then computes the expected_arrival_time as described in the next section and rejects 0-RTT if the expected_arrival_time is outside the recording window, falling back to the 1-RTT handshake. If the expected_arrival_time is in the window, then the server checks to see if it has recorded a matching ClientHello. If a matching ClientHello is found, the server either aborts the handshake with an \"illegal_parameter\" alert or accepts the PSK but rejects 0-RTT. If no matching ClientHello is found, then the server accepts 0-RTT and then stores the ClientHello for as long as the expected_arrival_time is inside the window. Servers MAY also implement data stores with false positives, such as Bloom filters, in which case they MUST respond to apparent replay by rejecting 0-RTT but MUST NOT abort the handshake. The server MUST derive the storage key only from validated sections of the ClientHello. If the ClientHello contains multiple PSK identities, then an attacker can create multiple ClientHellos with different binder values for the less-preferred identity on the assumption that the server will not verify the less-preferred identity (as recommended by Section 4.2.11). I.e., if the client sends PSKs A and B but the server prefers A, then the attacker can change the binder for B without affecting the binder for A. If the binder for B is part of the storage key, then this ClientHello will not appear as a duplicate, which will cause the ClientHello to be accepted, and may cause side effects such as replay cache pollution, although any 0-RTT data will not be decryptable because the data will use different keys. If the validated binder or the ClientHello.random is used as the storage key, then this attack is not possible. Because this mechanism does not require storing all outstanding tickets, it may be easier to implement in distributed systems with high rates of resumption and 0-RTT, at the cost of potentially weaker anti-replay defense because of the difficulty of reliably storing and retrieving the received ClientHello messages. In many such systems, it is impractical to have globally consistent storage of all the received ClientHellos. In this case, the best anti-replay protection is provided by having a single storage zone be authoritative for a given ticket and refusing 0-RTT for that ticket in any other zone. This approach prevents simple replay by the attacker because only one zone will accept 0-RTT data. A weaker design is to implement separate storage for each zone but allow 0-RTT in any zone. This approach limits the number of replays to once per zone. Application message duplication of course remains possible with either design. When implementations are freshly started, they SHOULD reject 0-RTT as long as any portion of their recording window overlaps the startup time. Otherwise, they run the risk of accepting replays which were originally sent during that period. If the client's clock is running much faster than the server's, then a ClientHello may be received that is outside the window in the future, in which case the ClientHello might be accepted for 1-RTT, causing a client retry, and then acceptable later for 0-RTT. This scenario is another variant of the second form of attack described in Section 8.",
  "7. Cryptographic Computations -> 7.1. Key Schedule": "The key derivation process makes use of the HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand functions as defined for HKDF [RFC5869], as well as the functions defined below: HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Context, Length) = HKDF-Expand(Secret, HkdfLabel, Length) where HkdfLabel is specified as: struct { uint16 length = Length; opaque label<7..255> = \"tls13 \" + Label; opaque context<0..255> = Context; } HkdfLabel; Derive-Secret(Secret, Label, Messages) = HKDF-Expand-Label(Secret, Label, Transcript-Hash(Messages), Hash.length). The Hash function used by Transcript-Hash and HKDF is the cipher suite hash algorithm. Hash.length is the output length of the Hash function in bytes. Messages is the concatenation of the indicated handshake messages, including the handshake message type and length fields, but not including record layer headers. Note that in some cases a zero- length Context (indicated by \"\") is passed to HKDF-Expand-Label. The labels specified in this document are all ASCII strings and do not include a trailing NUL byte. Note: With common hash functions, any label longer than 12 characters requires an additional iteration of the hash function to compute. The labels in this specification have all been chosen to fit within this limit. Keys are derived from two input secrets using the HKDF-Extract and Derive-Secret functions. The general pattern for adding a new secret is to use HKDF-Extract with the Salt being the current secret state and the Input Keying Material (IKM) being the new secret to be added. In this version of TLS 1.3, the two input secrets are: PSK (a pre-shared key established externally or derived from the resumption_master_secret value from a previous connection) and (EC)DHE shared secret (Section 7.4). This produces a full key derivation schedule shown in the diagram below. In this diagram, the following formatting conventions apply: HKDF-Extract is drawn as taking the Salt argument from the top and the IKM argument from the left, with its output to the bottom and the name of the output on the right. Derive-Secret's Secret argument is indicated by the incoming arrow. For instance, the Early Secret is the Secret for generating the client_early_traffic_secret. \"0\" indicates a string of Hash.length bytes set to zero. The key derivation schedule is: PSK -> HKDF-Extract = Early Secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"ext binder\" or \"res binder\", \"\") = binder_key -> Derive-Secret(., \"c e traffic\", ClientHello) = client_early_traffic_secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"e exp master\", ClientHello) = early_exporter_master_secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"derived\", \"\") -> (EC)DHE -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"c hs traffic\", ClientHello...ServerHello) = client_handshake_traffic_secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"s hs traffic\", ClientHello...ServerHello) = server_handshake_traffic_secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"derived\", \"\") -> 0 -> HKDF-Extract = Master Secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"c ap traffic\", ClientHello...server Finished) = client_application_traffic_secret_0 -> Derive-Secret(., \"s ap traffic\", ClientHello...server Finished) = server_application_traffic_secret_0 -> Derive-Secret(., \"exp master\", ClientHello...server Finished) = exporter_master_secret -> Derive-Secret(., \"res master\", ClientHello...client Finished) = resumption_master_secret. The general pattern here is that the secrets shown down the left side of the diagram are just raw entropy without context, whereas the secrets down the right side include Handshake Context and therefore can be used to derive working keys without additional context. Note that the different calls to Derive-Secret may take different Messages arguments, even with the same secret. In a 0-RTT exchange, Derive-Secret is called with four distinct transcripts; in a 1-RTT-only exchange, it is called with three distinct transcripts. If a given secret is not available, then the 0-value consisting of a string of Hash.length bytes set to zeros is used. Note that this does not mean skipping rounds, so if PSK is not in use, Early Secret will still be HKDF-Extract(0, 0). For the computation of the binder_key, the label is \"ext binder\" for external PSKs (those provisioned outside of TLS) and \"res binder\" for resumption PSKs (those provisioned as the resumption master secret of a previous handshake). The different labels prevent the substitution of one type of PSK for the other. There are multiple potential Early Secret values, depending on which PSK the server ultimately selects. The client will need to compute one for each potential PSK; if no PSK is selected, it will then need to compute the Early Secret corresponding to the zero PSK. Once all the values which are to be derived from a given secret have been computed, that secret SHOULD be erased.",
  "9. Compliance Requirements -> 9.3. Protocol Invariants": "This section describes invariants that TLS endpoints and middleboxes MUST follow. These invariants also apply to earlier versions of TLS. TLS is designed to be securely and compatibly extensible. Newer clients or servers, when communicating with newer peers, should negotiate the most preferred common parameters. The TLS handshake provides downgrade protection: Middleboxes passing traffic between a newer client and newer server without terminating TLS should be unable to influence the handshake (see Appendix E.1). At the same time, deployments update at different rates, so a newer client or server MAY continue to support older parameters, which would allow the newer client or server to interoperate with older endpoints. For this to work, implementations MUST correctly handle extensible fields: A client sending a ClientHello MUST support all parameters advertised in the ClientHello. Otherwise, the server may fail to interoperate by selecting one of those parameters. A server receiving a ClientHello MUST correctly ignore all unrecognized cipher suites, extensions, and other parameters. Otherwise, the server may fail to interoperate with newer clients. In TLS 1.3, a client receiving a CertificateRequest or NewSessionTicket MUST also ignore all unrecognized extensions. A middlebox which terminates a TLS connection MUST behave as a compliant TLS server (to the original client), including having a certificate which the client is willing to accept, and also as a compliant TLS client (to the original server), including verifying the original server's certificate. In particular, the middlebox MUST generate its own ClientHello containing only parameters the middlebox understands, and the middlebox MUST generate a fresh ServerHello random value, rather than forwarding the endpoint's value. Note that TLS's protocol requirements and security analysis only apply to the two connections separately. Safely deploying a TLS terminator requires additional security considerations which are beyond the scope of this document. A middlebox which forwards ClientHello parameters the middlebox does not understand MUST NOT process any messages beyond that ClientHello. The middlebox MUST forward all subsequent traffic unmodified. Otherwise, the middlebox may fail to interoperate with newer clients and servers. Forwarded ClientHellos may contain advertisements for features not supported by the middlebox, so the response may include future TLS additions the middlebox does not recognize. These additions MAY change any message beyond the ClientHello arbitrarily. In particular, the values sent in the ServerHello might change, the ServerHello format might change, and the TLSCiphertext format might change. The design of TLS 1.3 was constrained by widely deployed non-compliant TLS middleboxes (see Appendix D.4); however, TLS 1.3 does not relax the invariants. Those middleboxes continue to be non-compliant.",
  "11. IANA Considerations": "This document uses several registries that were originally created in RFC4346 Protocol Version 1.1 and updated in RFC8447. IANA has updated these registries to reference this document. The registries and their allocation policies are below: TLS Cipher Suites registry: values with the first byte in the range 0-254 decimal are assigned via Specification Required RFC8126. Values with the first byte 255 decimal are reserved for Private Use RFC8126. IANA has added the cipher suites listed in Appendix B.4 to the registry. The Value and Description columns are taken from the table. The DTLS-OK and Recommended columns are both marked as Y for each new cipher suite. TLS ContentType registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action RFC8126. TLS Alerts registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action RFC8126. IANA has populated the TLS Alerts registry with the values from Appendix B.2. The DTLS-OK column is marked as Y for all such values. Values marked as _RESERVED have comments describing their previous usage. TLS HandshakeType registry: Future values are allocated via Standards Action RFC8126. IANA has updated the TLS HandshakeType registry to rename item 4 from NewSessionTicket to new_session_ticket and populated this registry with the values from Appendix B.3. The DTLS-OK column is marked as Y for all such values. Values marked _RESERVED have comments describing their previous or temporary usage. This document also uses the TLS ExtensionType Values registry originally created in RFC4366 Extensions. IANA has updated the TLS ExtensionType Values registry to reference this document. Changes to the TLS ExtensionType Values registry follow: IANA has updated the registration policy as follows: Values with the first byte in the range 0-254 decimal are assigned via Specification Required RFC8126. Values with the first byte 255 decimal are reserved for Private Use RFC8126. IANA has updated the TLS ExtensionType Values registry to include the key_share, pre_shared_key, psk_key_exchange_modes, early_data, cookie, supported_versions, certificate_authorities, oid_filters, post_handshake_auth, and signature_algorithms_cert extensions with the values defined in this document and the Recommended value of Y. IANA has updated the TLS ExtensionType Values registry to include a TLS 1.3 column which lists the messages in which the extension may appear. The TLS 1.3 column has been initially populated from the table in Section 4.2, with any extension not listed there marked as - to indicate that it is not used by TLS 1.3. This document updates an entry in the TLS Certificate Types registry originally created in RFC6091 Authentication and updated in RFC8447. IANA has updated the entry for value 1 to have the name OpenPGP_RESERVED, Recommended value N, and comment Used in TLS versions prior to 1.3. This document updates an entry in the TLS Certificate Status Types registry originally created in RFC6961 Multiple Certificate Status Request Extension. IANA has updated the entry for value 2 to have the name ocsp_multi_RESERVED and comment Used in TLS versions prior to 1.3. This document updates two entries in the TLS Supported Groups registry created under a different name by RFC4492 Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security TLS; now maintained by RFC8422 Cipher Suites for Transport Layer Security TLS Versions 1.2 and Earlier and updated by RFC7919 and RFC8447. The entries for values 29 and 30 (x25519 and x448) have been updated to also refer to this document. In addition, this document defines two new registries that are maintained by IANA: TLS SignatureScheme registry: Values with the first byte in the range 0-253 decimal are assigned via Specification Required RFC8126. Values with the first byte 254 or 255 decimal are reserved for Private Use RFC8126. Values with the first byte in the range 0-6 or with the second byte in the range 0-3 that are not currently allocated are reserved for backward compatibility. The TLS SignatureScheme registry has a Recommended column. The TLS SignatureScheme registry has been initially populated with the values described in Section 4.2.3. The following values are marked as Recommended: ecdsa_secp256r1_sha256, ecdsa_secp384r1_sha384, rsa_pss_rsae_sha256, rsa_pss_rsae_sha384, rsa_pss_rsae_sha512, rsa_pss_pss_sha256, rsa_pss_pss_sha384, rsa_pss_pss_sha512, and ed25519. The Recommended column is assigned a value of N unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with a Recommended value of Y requires Standards Action RFC8126. IESG Approval is required for a Y to N transition. TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry: Values in the range 0-253 decimal are assigned via Specification Required RFC8126. The values 254 and 255 decimal are reserved for Private Use RFC8126. The TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry has a Recommended column. The TLS PskKeyExchangeMode registry has been initially populated with psk_ke 0 and psk_dhe_ke 1. Both are marked as Recommended. The Recommended column is assigned a value of N unless explicitly requested, and adding a value with a Recommended value of Y requires Standards Action RFC8126. IESG Approval is required for a Y to N transition."
