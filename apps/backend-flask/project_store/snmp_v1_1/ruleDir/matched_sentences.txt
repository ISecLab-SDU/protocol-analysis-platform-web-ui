Heading: 3. The SNMP Architecture -> 3.2. Elements of the Architecture -> 3.2.5. Definition of Administrative Relationships
Sentence: For every variable in the MIB view in a given SNMP community profile, access to that variable is represented by the profile according to the following conventions: (1) if the variable is defined in the MIB with "Access:" of "none," it is unavailable as an operand for any operator; (2) if the variable is defined in the MIB with "Access:" of "read-write" or "write-only" and the access mode of the given profile is READ-WRITE, that variable is available as an operand for the get, set, and trap operations; (3) otherwise, the variable is available as an operand for the get and trap operations.
