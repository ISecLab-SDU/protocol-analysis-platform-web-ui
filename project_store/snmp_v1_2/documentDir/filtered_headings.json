Trap-PDU is implicitly defined as a sequence with tag [4] containing enterprise as object identifier representing the type of object generating the trap, agent-addr as NetworkAddress representing the address of the object generating the trap, generic-trap as integer with values coldStart(0), warmStart(1), linkDown(2), linkUp(3), authenticationFailure(4), egpNeighborLoss(5), enterpriseSpecific(6), specific-trap as integer representing specific code present even if generic-trap is not enterpriseSpecific, time-stamp as TimeTicks representing time elapsed between the last reinitialization of the network entity and trap generation, and variable-bindings as VarBindList containing interesting information. Variable bindings are defined with VarBind as a sequence containing name as ObjectName and value as ObjectSyntax, and VarBindList as a sequence of VarBind.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
