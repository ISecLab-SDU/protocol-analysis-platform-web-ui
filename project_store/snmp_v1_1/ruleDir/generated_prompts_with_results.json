The rule describes a specific SNMP v1 protocol message type or its internal fields, and this message type can be received by an SNMP v1 protocol server implementation.\n2. The rule explicitly describes or implies, through field value ranges or format definitions, the processing logic that the protocol program should apply after receiving the input message. This logic must be detailed enough to directly guide a developer’s implementation.\n3. The described message processing logic pertains to handling a single message or to verifying the consistency of its fields against those from a previous message in the same protocol exchange, without involving concurrency or complex multi-step state machine logic.\n\nFor each rule:\n- If all three criteria (1, 2, and 3) are satisfied, respond with \"Conforms.\"\n- If any criterion is not met, respond with \"Does not conform.\"\n\nPlease omit all explanatory content.\n",
