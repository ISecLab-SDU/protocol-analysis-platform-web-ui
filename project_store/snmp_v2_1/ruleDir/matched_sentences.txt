Sentence: (8) Otherwise, if the variable binding's name specifies a variable which does not exist but can not be created under the present circumstances (even though it could be created under other circumstances), then the value of the Response-PDU's error-status field is set to `inconsistentName', and the value of its error- index field is set to the index of the failed variable binding.

Sentence: (10) Otherwise, if the variable binding's value field specifies a value that could under other circumstances be held by the variable, but is presently inconsistent or otherwise unable to be assigned to the variable, then the value of the Response-PDU's error-status field is set to `inconsistentValue', and the value of its error-index field is set to the index of the failed variable binding.

Sentence: (11) When, during the above steps, the assignment of the value specified by the variable binding's value field to the specified variable requires the allocation of a resource which is presently unavailable, then the value of the Response-PDU's error-status field is set to `resourceUnavailable', and the value of its error- index field is set to the index of the failed variable binding.

Sentence: At the end of the first phase, if the validation of all variable bindings succeeded, then the value of the Response-PDU's error-status field is set to `noError' and the value of its error-index field is zero, and processing continues as follows.

Heading: 4. Protocol Specification -> 4.2. PDU Processing -> 4.2.5. The SetRequest-PDU
Sentence: If any of these assignments fail (even after all the previous validations), then all other assignments are undone, and the Response-PDU is modified to have the value of its error-status field set to `commitFailed', and the value of its error-index field set to the index of the failed variable binding.
